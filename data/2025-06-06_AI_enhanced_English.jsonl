However, the amount of publicly available Verilog\ncode pales in comparison to the amount of code available for software languages\nlike Python. In this work, we present hdl2v (\"HDL-to-Verilog\"), a dataset which\nseeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by\ntranslating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL,\nChisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v\nin enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32\nbillion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2,\nwithout utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger\nmodels. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data\naugmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%. Finally, we characterize and\nanalyze our dataset to better understand which characteristics of\nHDL-to-Verilog datasets can be expanded upon in future work for even better\nperformance.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces hdl2v, a dataset translating VHDL, Chisel, and PyMTL3 to Verilog to address the scarcity of human-written Verilog data.
