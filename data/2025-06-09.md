### [1] [An Execution Model for RICE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05839)
*Steven Libby*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文扩展了RICE编译器的工作，提出了其执行模型，展示了为生成可执行代码对FlatCurry语言的限制，并使用类似Launchbury的操作语义描述了执行模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于RICE编译器的先前工作，进一步明确其执行模型，以确保生成的代码符合Curry的标准操作语义。

Method: 通过限制FlatCurry语言并采用类似Launchbury的操作语义，构建执行模型。

Result: 执行模型与Curry的标准操作语义一致。

Conclusion: 提出的执行模型有效且符合标准，为RICE编译器的进一步开发提供了理论基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we build on the previous work of the RICE compiler by giving
its execution model. We show the restrictions to the FlatCurry language that
were made to produce executable code, and present the execution model using
operational semantics similar to Launchbury. Finally, we show that the
execution model conforms with the standard operational semantics for Curry.

### [2] [A Sound and Complete Characterization of Fair Asynchronous Session Subtyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06078)
*Mario Bravetti,Luca Padovani,Gianluigi Zavattaro*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种对异步会话类型的公平精化关系进行完整表征的方法，填补了现有研究的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 会话类型是通信协议的抽象，支持对消息传递过程的静态分析。精化关系对于支持安全的过程替换至关重要，但现有的异步会话类型精化关系表征不完整。

Method: 通过一种新型的标记转换系统嵌入异步语义，对异步公平精化关系进行完整表征。

Result: 提出了一种对异步会话类型公平精化的完备表征方法，并与同步会话类型的表征进行了关联。

Conclusion: 本文解决了异步会话类型公平精化的完备表征问题，为通信协议的设计和分析提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Session types are abstractions of communication protocols enabling the static
analysis of message-passing processes. Refinement notions for session types are
key to support safe forms of process substitution while preserving their
compatibility with the rest of the system. Recently, a fair refinement relation
for asynchronous session types has been defined allowing the anticipation of
message outputs with respect to an unbounded number of message inputs. This
refinement is useful to capture common patterns in communication protocols that
take advantage of asynchrony. However, while the semantic (\`a la testing)
definition of such refinement is straightforward, its characterization has
proved to be quite challenging. In fact, only a sound but not complete
characterization is known so far. In this paper we close this open problem by
presenting a sound and complete characterization of asynchronous fair
refinement for session types. We relate this characterization to those given in
the literature for synchronous session types by leveraging a novel labelled
transition system of session types that embeds their asynchronous semantics.

### [3] [CompilerGPT: Leveraging Large Language Models for Analyzing and Acting on Compiler Optimization Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06227)
*Peter Pirkelbauer*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文提出CompilerGPT框架，利用大语言模型（LLM）理解和重写编译器优化报告，实验显示最高6.5倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前编译器优化报告复杂难懂，程序员难以有效利用。

Method: 引入CompilerGPT框架，自动化编译器、LLM和用户测试的交互，进行多轮迭代并报告结果。

Result: 实验使用两种LLM（GPT-4o和Claude Sonnet）、两种编译器（Clang和GCC）和五个基准代码，最高获得6.5倍加速，但结果不一致。

Conclusion: 该方法有望提升编译器易用性并优化软件流程。

Abstract: Current compiler optimization reports often present complex, technical
information that is difficult for programmers to interpret and act upon
effectively. This paper assesses the capability of large language models (LLM)
to understand compiler optimization reports and automatically rewrite the code
accordingly.
  To this end, the paper introduces CompilerGPT, a novel framework that
automates the interaction between compilers, LLMs, and user defined test and
evaluation harness. CompilerGPT's workflow runs several iterations and reports
on the obtained results.
  Experiments with two leading LLM models (GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet),
optimization reports from two compilers (Clang and GCC), and five benchmark
codes demonstrate the potential of this approach. Speedups of up to 6.5x were
obtained, though not consistently in every test. This method holds promise for
improving compiler usability and streamlining the software optimization
process.
