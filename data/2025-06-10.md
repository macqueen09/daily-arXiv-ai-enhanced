Conclusion: 论文提出的方法在工业级数学优化建模中具有实际应用价值，并通过egg_recursive工具简化了复杂项的编写和维护。

Abstract: In solving mathematical optimization problems efficiently, it is crucial to
make use of information about specific types of constraints, such as the
one-hot or Special-Ordered Set (SOS) constraints. In many cases, exploiting
such information gives asymptotically better execution time. JijModeling, an
industrial-strength mathematical optimization modeller, achieves this by
separating the symbolic representation of an optimization problem from the
input data. In this paper, we will report a real-world case study on a
constraint detection mechanism modulo the algebraic congruence using e-graphs,
and describe heuristic criteria for designing rewriting systems. We give
benchmarking result that shows the performance impact of the constraint
detection mechanism.
  We also introduce egg_recursive, a utility library for writing egg-terms as
recursive abstract syntax trees, reducing the burden of writing and maintaining
complex terms in S-expressions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂软件中，内部可信代码与外部不可信代码紧密交织，程序员需在不信任外部代码的情况下推理其潜在影响。

Method: 提出新的能力访问断言、效果限制规范及Hoare逻辑，通过运行示例和机械化证明验证模块规范。

Result: 展示了方法的有效性，并证明了Hoare逻辑的正确性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效限制外部调用影响，提升内部代码的可验证性。

Abstract: In today's complex software, internal trusted code is tightly intertwined
with external untrusted code. To reason about internal code, programmers must
reason about the potential effects of calls to external code, even though that
code is not trusted and may not even be available. The effects of external
calls can be limited, if internal code is programmed defensively, limiting
potential effects by limiting access to the capabilities necessary to cause
those effects.
  This paper addresses the specification and verification of internal code that
relies on encapsulation and object capabilities to limit the effects of
external calls. We propose new assertions for access to capabilities, new
specifications for limiting effects, and a Hoare logic to verify that a module
satisfies its specification, even while making external calls. We illustrate
the approach though a running example with mechanised proofs, and prove
soundness of the Hoare logic.

### [3] [Execution-Aware Program Reduction for WebAssembly via Record and Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07834)
*Doehyun Baek,Daniel Lehmann,Ben L. Titzer,Sukyoung Ryu,Michael Pradel*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文提出了RR-Reduce和Hybrid-Reduce两种执行感知的程序缩减技术，通过记录和重放执行行为来优化WebAssembly程序的调试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于静态信息的程序缩减技术难以处理复杂WebAssembly程序，需利用执行行为信息提升效率。

Method: RR-Reduce通过识别并隔离触发错误的函数，生成仅重放目标函数交互的缩减程序；Hybrid-Reduce结合执行感知与非感知技术进一步缩减程序。

Result: RR-Reduce平均将程序缩减至原大小的1.20%，耗时14.5分钟；Hybrid-Reduce缩减至0.13%，耗时3.5小时，均显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: RR-Reduce适合快速调试，Hybrid-Reduce适用于需最小化程序的场景。

Abstract: WebAssembly (Wasm) programs may trigger bugs in their engine implementations.
To aid debugging, program reduction techniques try to produce a smaller variant
of the input program that still triggers the bug. However, existing
execution-unaware program reduction techniques struggle with large and complex
Wasm programs, because they rely on static information and apply syntactic
transformations, while ignoring the valuable information offered by the input
program's execution behavior.
  We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program
reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay.
RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates
that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program
that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of
the program. Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction
technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size.
  We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a
diverse set of bugs in three engines. On average, RR-Reduce reduces the
programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which
outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time.
Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in
3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of
reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time. We envision
RR-Reduce as the go-to tool for rapid, on-demand debugging in minutes, and
Hybrid-Reduce for scenarios where developers require the smallest possible
programs.

### [4] [Hadamard-$Π$: Equational Quantum Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06835)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Error

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum computing offers advantages over classical computation, yet the
precise features that set the two apart remain unclear. In the standard quantum
circuit model, adding a 1-qubit basis-changing gate -- commonly chosen to be
the Hadamard gate -- to a universal set of classical reversible gates yields
computationally universal quantum computation. However, the computational
behaviours enabled by this addition are not fully characterised. We give such a
characterisation by introducing a small quantum programming language extending
the universal classical reversible programming language $\Pi$ with a single
primitive corresponding to the Hadamard gate. The language comes equipped with
a sound and complete categorical semantics that is specified by a purely
equational theory, enabling reasoning about the equivalence of quantum programs
in a way that can be automated. Completeness is shown by means of a novel
finite presentation, and corresponding synthesis algorithm, for the groups of
orthogonal matrices with entries in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]$.
