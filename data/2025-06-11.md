### [1] [Verification of the Release-Acquire Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08238)
*Parosh Abdulla,Elli Anastasiadi,Mohamed Faouzi Atig,Samuel Grahn*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文研究了并发语义中的Release-Acquire（RA）及其变体（SRA和WRA）的验证问题，填补了现有研究的空白。通过寄存器机器模型，分析了验证这些语义的复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注单次程序执行是否符合内存模型，而更普遍的验证问题（即所有允许的程序运行是否一致）研究较少。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用寄存器机器模型描述实现，检查其运行是否违反RA、SRA或WRA语义。

Result: 验证WRA的复杂度为O(n^5)，而验证RA和SRA是NP-和coNP-难的，并提供了PSPACE上界。

Conclusion: 研究不仅回答了这些问题的基本复杂度，还揭示了寄存器机器模型的表达能力。

Abstract: The Release-Acquire (RA) semantics and its variants are some of the most
fundamental models of concurrent semantics for architectures, programming
languages, and distributed systems. Several steps have been taken in the
direction of testing such semantics, where one is interested in whether a
single program execution is consistent with a memory model. The more general
verification problem, i.e., checking whether all allowed program runs are
consistent with a memory model, has still not been studied as much. The purpose
of this work is to bridge this gap. We tackle the verification problem, where,
given an implementation described as a register machine, we check if any of its
runs violates the RA semantics or its Strong (SRA) and Weak (WRA) variants. We
show that verifying WRA in this setup is in O([)n5 ], while verifying the RA
and SRA is in both NP- and coNP-hard, and provide a PSPACE upper bound. This
both answers some fundamental questions about the complexity of these problems,
but also provides insights on the expressive power of register machines as a
model.

### [2] [Linguine: A Natural-Language Programming Language with Formal Semantics and a Clean Compiler Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08396)
*Lifan Hu*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Linguine是一种受自然语言启发的编程语言，允许用户用流畅的英语子集编写程序，同时保留形式语义。它通过静态解析代词变量（如“it”、“them”）确保无歧义和类型安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在开发一种编程语言，既能利用人类语言直觉，又能保持形式化方法和类型理论的严谨性。

Method: 引入代词变量并通过引用跟踪分析和Hindley-Milner类型系统静态解析，编译器流程包括词法分析、解析、类型推断等。

Result: Linguine支持编写简洁易读的程序，并实现静态验证，其代词解析机制被证明是可靠的。

Conclusion: Linguine为结合人类语言直觉与形式化方法的编程系统提供了初步探索。

Abstract: Linguine is a natural-language-inspired programming language that enables
users to write programs in a fluent, controlled subset of English while
preserving formal semantics. The language introduces anaphoric constructs, such
as pronoun variables (e.g., "it", "them"), that are statically resolved through
referent-tracking analysis combined with a Hindley-Milner-style type system.
Each pronoun is guaranteed to be unambiguous and well-typed at compile time.
  The Linguine compiler pipeline includes lexing, parsing, clause graph
construction, desugaring into a typed intermediate representation, type
inference, and abstract interpretation. This enables the early detection of
semantic errors, such as undefined or type-inconsistent references. A
lightweight backend currently generates Python code.
  This paper formalizes the core language, defines its typing and operational
semantics, and proves the soundness of its pronoun resolution mechanism. An
initial evaluation shows that Linguine allows the expression of concise and
readable programs while supporting static verification.
  Linguine represents a step toward programming systems that prioritize human
linguistic intuition while remaining grounded in formal methods and
type-theoretic rigor.

### [3] [Gradual Metaprogramming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09043)
*Tianyu Chen,Darshal Shetty,Jeremy G. Siek,Chao-Hong Chen,Weixi Ma,Arnaud Venet,Rocky Liu*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种逐步元编程方法，用于解决Python中嵌入式DSL（如Meta的F3 DSL）在调试和类型错误检测中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 嵌入式DSL在Python中动态生成静态类型的数据管道代码时，调试困难且错误检测延迟。

Method: 采用逐步元编程方法，通过类型检查代码片段和增量运行时检查，实现早期错误检测和错误定位。

Result: 定义了MetaGTLC元编程演算，并通过翻译到MetaCC演算实现语义，证明其能生成类型正确的对象程序。

Conclusion: 逐步元编程为静态类型DSL提供了迁移路径，并显著提升了调试效率。

Abstract: Data engineers increasingly use domain-specific languages (DSLs) to generate
the code for data pipelines. Such DSLs are often embedded in Python.
Unfortunately, there are challenges in debugging the generation of data
pipelines: an error in a Python DSL script is often detected too late, after
the execution of the script, and the source code location that triggers the
error is hard to pinpoint.
  In this paper, we focus on the F3 DSL of Meta (Facebook), which is a DSL
embedded in Python (so it is dynamically-typed) to generate data pipeline
description code that is statically-typed. We propose gradual metaprogramming
to (1) provide a migration path toward statically typed DSLs, (2) immediately
provide earlier detection of code generation type errors, and (3) report the
source code location responsible for the type error. Gradual metaprogramming
accomplishes this by type checking code fragments and incrementally performing
runtime checks as they are spliced together. We define MetaGTLC, a
metaprogramming calculus in which a gradually-typed metalanguage manipulates a
statically-typed object language, and give semantics to it by translation to
the cast calculus MetaCC. We prove that successful metaevaluation always
generates a well-typed object program and mechanize the proof in Agda.
