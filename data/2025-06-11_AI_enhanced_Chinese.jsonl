Several steps have been taken in the\ndirection of testing such semantics, where one is interested in whether a\nsingle program execution is consistent with a memory model. The more general\nverification problem, i.e., checking whether all allowed program runs are\nconsistent with a memory model, has still not been studied as much. The purpose\nof this work is to bridge this gap. We tackle the verification problem, where,\ngiven an implementation described as a register machine, we check if any of its\nruns violates the RA semantics or its Strong (SRA) and Weak (WRA) variants. We\nshow that verifying WRA in this setup is in O([)n5 ], while verifying the RA\nand SRA is in both NP- and coNP-hard, and provide a PSPACE upper bound. This\nboth answers some fundamental questions about the complexity of these problems,\nbut also provides insights on the expressive power of register machines as a\nmodel.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e76\u53d1\u8bed\u4e49\u4e2d\u7684Release-Acquire\uff08RA\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\uff08SRA\u548cWRA\uff09\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u673a\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u6b21\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6267\u884c\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u66f4\u666e\u904d\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5373\u6240\u6709\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8fd0\u884c\u662f\u5426\u4e00\u81f4\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u673a\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u68c0\u67e5\u5176\u8fd0\u884c\u662f\u5426\u8fdd\u53cdRA\u3001SRA\u6216WRA\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1WRA\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(n^5)\uff0c\u800c\u9a8c\u8bc1RA\u548cSRA\u662fNP-\u548ccoNP-\u96be\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86PSPACE\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u56de\u7b54\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u673a\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We propose gradual metaprogramming\nto (1) provide a migration path toward statically typed DSLs, (2) immediately\nprovide earlier detection of code generation type errors, and (3) report the\nsource code location responsible for the type error. Gradual metaprogramming\naccomplishes this by type checking code fragments and incrementally performing\nruntime checks as they are spliced together. We define MetaGTLC, a\nmetaprogramming calculus in which a gradually-typed metalanguage manipulates a\nstatically-typed object language, and give semantics to it by translation to\nthe cast calculus MetaCC.
