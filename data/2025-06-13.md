### [1] [From Tool Calling to Symbolic Thinking: LLMs in a Persistent Lisp Metaprogramming Loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10021)
*Jordi de la Torre*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 提出了一种将大语言模型（LLMs）与交互式Lisp环境结合的新架构，支持LLMs通过REPL动态定义和调用工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何将符号编程与神经语言生成结合，以实现状态化外部存储和动态工具创建。

Method: 通过中间件层拦截Lisp表达式，嵌入生成过程中，实现程序化交互。

Result: 设计了一个框架和架构原则，支持交互式AI系统的未来实现。

Conclusion: 该架构为结合符号编程与神经语言生成的交互式AI系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture for integrating large language models (LLMs)
with a persistent, interactive Lisp environment. This setup enables LLMs to
define, invoke, and evolve their own tools through programmatic interaction
with a live REPL. By embedding Lisp expressions within generation and
intercepting them via a middleware layer, the system allows for stateful
external memory, reflective programming, and dynamic tool creation. We present
a design framework and architectural principles to guide future implementations
of interactive AI systems that integrate symbolic programming with neural
language generation.

### [2] [A Language-Agnostic Logical Relation for Message-Passing Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10026)
*Tesla Zhang,Sonya Simkin,Rui Li,Yue Yao,Stephanie Balzer*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用于验证异构消息传递系统协议合规性的框架，首次实现了语言无关的逻辑关系机械化，支持任意对象（包括外部对象）的验证，并在Coq中实现了案例研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着分布式和异构系统（如云计算和物联网）的普及，验证这些系统的协议合规性变得复杂，传统基于共同语言或类型系统的方法不再适用。

Method: 开发了一个基于标记转移语义的语言无关逻辑关系框架，支持对任意对象（包括外部对象）的验证，并在Coq中实现了两种验证场景的机械化。

Result: 框架成功验证了两种场景：（1）特定应用或硬件设备的实例级验证，（2）给定类型系统中良好类型化应用的一劳永逸验证。

Conclusion: 该框架为异构消息传递系统的协议合规性提供了通用且灵活的验证方法，适用于广泛的实际应用场景。

Abstract: Today's computing landscape has been gradually shifting to applications
targeting distributed and *heterogeneous* systems, such as cloud computing and
Internet of Things (IoT) applications. These applications are predominantly
*concurrent*, employ *message-passing*, and interface with *foreign objects*,
ranging from externally implemented code to actual physical devices such as
sensors. Verifying that the resulting systems adhere to the intended protocol
of interaction is challenging -- the usual assumption of a common
implementation language, let alone a type system, no longer applies, ruling out
any verification method based on them. This paper develops a framework for
certifying *protocol compliance* of heterogeneous message-passing systems. It
contributes the first mechanization of a *language-agnostic logical relation*,
asserting that its inhabitants comply with the protocol specified. This
definition relies entirely on a labelled transition-based semantics,
accommodating arbitrary inhabitants, typed and untyped alike, including foreign
objects. As a case study, the paper considers two scenarios: (1) *per-instance
verification* of a specific application or hardware device, and (2)
*once-and-for-all verification* of well-typed applications for a given type
system. The logical relation and both scenarios are mechanized in the Coq
theorem prover.

### [3] [Hazel Deriver: A Live Editor for Constructing Rule-Based Derivations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10781)
*Zhiyao Zhong,Cyrus Omar*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Hazel Deriver是一个基于网络的实时编辑器，旨在通过多层次支持帮助学生构建基于规则的推导树，减少任务难度并提升理解和参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学生在编程语言和形式逻辑课程中常因推理规则复杂、缺乏即时反馈和手工证明的繁琐而难以构建推导树。

Method: 基于Hazel实时编程环境开发，提供结构化、交互式体验，支持迭代探索和实时反馈。

Result: 初步用户研究表明，Hazel Deriver降低了推导任务的感知难度，提升了概念理解和参与度。

Conclusion: 讨论了分层支持功能的设计，并探讨了系统指导与学习者自主性之间的平衡问题。

Abstract: Students in programming languages and formal logic courses often struggle
with constructing rule-based derivation trees due to the complexity of applying
inference rules, the lack of immediate feedback, and the manual effort required
for handwritten proofs. We present Hazel Deriver, a live, web-based editor
designed to scaffold derivation construction through multiple layers of
support. Built on the Hazel live programming environment, it provides a
structured, interactive experience that encourages iterative exploration and
real-time feedback. A preliminary user study with former students suggests that
Hazel Deriver reduces the perceived difficulty of derivation tasks while
improving conceptual understanding and engagement. We discuss the design of its
layered scaffolding features and raise questions about balancing system
guidance with learner autonomy.

### [4] [Choreographic Quick Changes: First-Class Location (Set) Polymorphism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10913)
*Ashley Samuelson,Andrew K. Hirsch,Ethan Cecchetti*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的编排编程语言λQC，支持动态计算和传递计算节点的能力，并扩展了表达能力和类型系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编排语言缺乏现代系统所需的关键功能，如动态计算和传递节点决策的能力。

Method: 设计了λQC语言，支持第一类进程名、类型和位置的多态性，以及代数与递归数据类型。

Result: λQC在表达能力上优于现有工作，并通过Rocq形式化和验证了其无死锁性。

Conclusion: λQC填补了编排语言的空白，提供了更强的表达能力和类型安全性。

Abstract: Choreographic programming is a promising new paradigm for programming
concurrent systems where a developer writes a single centralized program that
compiles to individual programs for each node. Existing choreographic
languages, however, lack critical features integral to modern systems, like the
ability of one node to dynamically compute who should perform a computation and
send that decision to others. This work addresses this gap with $\lambda_{QC}$,
the first typed choreographic language with \emph{first class process names}
and polymorphism over both types and (sets of) locations. $\lambda_{QC}$ also
improves expressive power over previous work by supporting algebraic and
recursive data types as well as multiply-located values. We formalize and
mechanically verify our results in Rocq, including the standard choreographic
guarantee of deadlock freedom.

### [5] [Reward Models Enable Scalable Code Verification by Trading Accuracy for Throughput](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10056)
*Gabriel Orlanski,Nicholas Roberts,Aws Albarghouthi,Frederic Sala*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文挑战了在LLM编程任务中优先使用全面验证器（如完整测试套件）的共识，通过系统探索速度与准确性的权衡，发现结果奖励模型（ORM）在牺牲少量准确性（8.33%）的情况下显著提升速度（11.65倍）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是质疑当前优先使用全面验证器的共识，探索速度与准确性之间的权衡。

Method: 采用生成-修剪-排序方法，先用较快的ORM验证器过滤错误解，再用全面验证器排序。

Result: 结果显示，该方法在仅降低8.33%准确性的情况下，速度提升11.65倍。

Conclusion: 结论表明，ORM在可扩展且准确的程序排序系统设计中具有重要价值。

Abstract: The standard paradigm for solving coding tasks via large language models
(LLMs) is to generate-then-rank programs, where the latter step uses a verifier
in the ranking process. The growing consensus is that a comprehensive verifier
(e.g., a full test suite) should be prioritized over an outcome reward model
(ORM) whenever possible, with little consideration given to the trade-offs
involved. We aim to challenge this assumption by systematically exploring the
tradeoff between speed and accuracy. We find that ORMs play a crucial role in
scaling verification through trading accuracy for speed, even when a
comprehensive verifier is available. Their value becomes especially apparent
when used in a generate-prune-then-rank approach, where a faster but less
accurate verifier removes incorrect solutions prior to ranking -- leading to a
system that is 11.65x faster while only being 8.33% less accurate than the full
test suite. We analyze the generate-prune-then-rank approach and show that it
works by filtering out incorrect but highly ranked solutions. These findings
enable the design of scalable and accurate program ranking systems.

### [6] [Solving Package Management via Hypergraph Dependency Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10803)
*Ryan Gibb,Patrick Ferris,David Allsopp,Michael Winston Dales,Mark Elvers,Thomas Gazagnaire,Sadiq Jaffer,Thomas Leonard,Jon Ludlam,Anil Madhavapeddy*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: HyperRes是一个基于超图的版本化依赖解析系统，支持跨语言生态系统的依赖管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言项目中依赖管理不互通的问题，以及外部系统和硬件依赖的隐式和无版本化问题。

Method: 定义HyperRes系统，通过超图建模依赖关系，并支持现有包管理器的元数据转换。

Result: 证明依赖解析可以在当前独立的生态系统中跨平台工作，无需用户更换包管理器。

Conclusion: HyperRes提供了一种跨生态系统的依赖管理解决方案，支持精确的部署环境适配。

Abstract: Package managers are everywhere, with seemingly every language and operating
system implementing their own solution. The lack of interoperability between
these systems means that multi-lingual projects are unable to express precise
dependencies across language ecosystems, and external system and hardware
dependencies are typically implicit and unversioned. We define HyperRes, a
formal system for describing versioned dependency resolution using a hypergraph
that is expressive enough to model many ecosystems and solve dependency
constraints across them. We define translations from dozens of existing package
managers to HyperRes and comprehensively demonstrate that dependency resolution
can work across ecosystems that are currently distinct. This does not require
users to shift their choice of package managers; instead, HyperRes allows for
the translation of packaging metadata between ecosystems, and for solving to be
precisely specialised to a particular deployment environment.
