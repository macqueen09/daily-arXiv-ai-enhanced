### [1] [A Performance Model for Warp Specialization Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11209)
*Zhengyang Liu,Vinod Grover*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对warp specialization内核的性能模型，通过微分方程和实验验证提供准确的执行时间预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究warp specialization内核的性能影响因素，以优化GPU加速应用。

Method: 利用微分方程建模，并通过仿真和实验验证模型准确性。

Result: 模型能准确预测执行时间，并为编译器优化、内核参数调整和算法设计提供实用指导。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅深化了对warp specialization技术的理解，还为GPU应用优化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: This paper presents a performance model tailored for warp specialization
kernels, focusing on factors such as warp size, tilling size, input matrix
size, memory bandwidth, and thread divergence. Our model offers accurate
predictions of execution time by leveraging differential equations validated
through simulations and experiments. The insights gained from this model not
only enhance our understanding of warp specialization techniques but also have
practical implications for optimizing GPU-accelerated applications through
compiler optimizations, kernel parameter tuning, and algorithm design.

### [2] [PermRust: A Token-based Permission System for Rust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11701)
*Lukas Gehring,Sebastian Rehms,Florian Tschorsch*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Rust编程语言的权限系统PermRust，用于管理库级别的系统资源访问，通过类型系统实现零成本抽象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有操作系统权限系统仅能管理进程级别的访问，而现代软件常使用第三方库代码，因此需要库级别的权限系统以增强安全性。

Method: 借鉴能力系统的概念，构建编程语言级别的权限系统理论基础，并在Rust中实现为类型系统的零成本抽象。

Result: 开发了PermRust，一个基于令牌的权限系统，能够按库管理对系统资源的访问。

Conclusion: PermRust为库级别的权限管理提供了理论支持和实践工具，增强了安全性。

Abstract: Permission systems which restrict access to system resources are a
well-established technology in operating systems, especially for smartphones.
However, as such systems are implemented in the operating system they can at
most manage access on the process-level. Since moderns software often (re)uses
code from third-parties libraries, a permission system for libraries can be
desirable to enhance security. In this short-paper, we adapt concepts from
capability systems building a novel theoretical foundation for permission
system at the level of the programming language. This leads to PermRust, a
token-based permission system for the Rust programming language as a zero cost
abstraction on top of its type-system. With it access to system resources can
be managed per library.

### [3] [ALEA IACTA EST: A Declarative Domain-Specific Language for Manually Performable Random Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11794)
*Baltasar Trancón y Widemann,Markus Lepper*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Alea是一种用于描述随机实验的领域特定语言，适合非专业程序员使用，支持静态分析和动态模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为初等随机学教学和游戏设计提供简单清晰的工具，便于非专家使用。

Method: 设计Alea语言，结合函数式编程和基础数学概念，支持静态分析和动态执行。

Result: Alea语言可用于分析概率分布或模拟实验，目前仍在开发中。

Conclusion: Alea为随机实验提供了一种易用的编程语言，适合教学和游戏设计，但仍在完善中。

Abstract: Random experiments that are simple and clear enough to be performed by human
agents feature prominently in the teaching of elementary stochastics as well as
in games. We present Alea, a domain-specific language for the specification of
random experiments. Alea code can either be analyzed statically to obtain and
inspect probability distributions of outcomes, or be executed with a source
pseudo-randomness for simulation or as a game assistant. The language is
intended for ease of use by non-expert programmers, in particular students of
elementary stochastics, and players and designers of games of chance, by
focusing on concepts common to functional programming and basic mathematics.
Both the design of the language and the implementation of runtime environments
are work in progress.

### [4] [From Reasoning to Code: GRPO Optimization for Underrepresented Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11027)
*Federico Pennino,Bianca Raimondi,Massimo Rondelli,Andrea Gurioli,Maurizio Gabbrielli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合GRPO和小规模代码模型的方法，用于生成低资源语言的准确可执行代码，并以Prolog为例验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在低资源语言（如Prolog）上生成准确可执行代码的挑战。

Method: 使用Qwen 2.5小规模代码模型结合GRPO，通过显式推理步骤生成代码，并将推理反馈集成到强化学习循环中。

Result: 模型在数学逻辑问题基准测试中表现出显著提升，生成逻辑一致且语法准确的代码。

Conclusion: 该方法为缺乏训练资源的编程语言提供了一种有效的代码生成解决方案。

Abstract: Generating accurate and executable code using large language models (LLMs) is
challenging for languages with limited public training data compared to popular
languages such as Python. This paper introduces a generalizable approach that
uses small-scale code versions of the Qwen 2.5 model combined with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enable effective code generation through
explicit reasoning steps, which is particularly beneficial for languages with
smaller source code databases. Using Prolog as a representative use case --
given its limited online presence -- the initial model faced challenges in
generating executable code. After some training steps, the model successfully
produces logically consistent and syntactically accurate code by directly
integrating reasoning-driven feedback into the reinforcement learning loop.
Experimental evaluations using mathematical logic problem benchmarks illustrate
significant improvements in reasoning quality, code accuracy, and logical
correctness, underscoring the potential of this approach to benefit a wide
range of programming languages lacking extensive training resources.
