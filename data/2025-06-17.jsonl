Rather than directly calling tools,\nit can be more effective for LLMs to write code to perform the tool calls,\nenabling them to automatically generate complex control flow such as\nconditionals and loops. Such code actions are typically provided as Python\ncode, since LLMs are quite proficient at it; however, Python may not be the\nideal language due to limited built-in support for performance, security, and\nreliability. We propose a novel programming language for code actions, called\nQuasar, which has several benefits: (1) automated parallelization to improve\nperformance, (2) uncertainty quantification to improve reliability and mitigate\nhallucinations, and (3) security features enabling the user to validate\nactions. LLMs can write code in a subset of Python, which is automatically\ntranspiled to Quasar. We evaluate our approach on the ViperGPT visual question\nanswering agent, applied to the GQA dataset, demonstrating that LLMs with\nQuasar actions instead of Python actions retain strong performance, while\nreducing execution time when possible by 42%, improving security by reducing\nuser approval interactions when possible by 52%, and improving reliability by\napplying conformal prediction to achieve a desired target coverage level."}

However, a known issue with freer monads is that they are\nnot amenable to static analysis. This paper explores freer arrows, a relatively\nexpressive structure that is amenable to static analysis. We propose several\nvariants of freer arrows. We conduct a case study on choreographic programming\nto demonstrate the usefulness of freer arrows in Haskell."}

By viewing the variables and stack\nas the (parsed) headers and (to-be-parsed) contents of a network packet,\nStacKAT can express a wide range of network behaviors including parsing, source\nrouting, and telemetry. These behaviors are difficult or impossible to model\nusing existing languages like NetKAT. We develop a decision procedure for\nStacKAT program equivalence, based on finite automata. This decision procedure\nprovides the theoretical basis for verifying network-wide properties and is\nable to provide counterexamples for inequivalent programs. Finally, we provide\nan axiomatization of StacKAT equivalence and establish its completeness."}
