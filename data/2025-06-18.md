Conclusion: 改进的FreeCHR算法为CHR嵌入提供了高效统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) is a rule-based programming language that rewrites collections of constraints. It is typically embedded into a general-purpose language. There exists a plethora of implementations for numerous host languages. However, the existing implementations often re-invent the method of embedding, which impedes maintenance and weakens assertions of correctness. To formalize and thereby unify the embedding of a ground subset of CHR into arbitrary host languages, we introduced the framework FreeCHR and proved it to be a valid representation of classical CHR. For the sake of simplicity, abstract implementations of our framework did not yet include a concrete matching algorithm nor optimizations. In this paper, we introduce an improved execution algorithm for FreeCHR. We also provide an evaluation of the algorithm via benchmarks which suggest the effectiveness of our implemented optimizations.

Motivation: 研究Wu的正λ演算的抽象机器效率问题，并提出优化方案。

Method: 定义自然抽象机器，分析其效率问题，设计基于新切片技术的优化机器。

Result: 优化后的机器解决了效率问题，避免了二次时间减速。

Conclusion: 通过新切片技术，优化机器在正λ演算中实现了高效运行。

Abstract: Wu's positive $λ$-calculus is a recent call-by-value $λ$-calculus with sharing coming from Miller and Wu's study of the proof-theoretical concept of focalization. Accattoli and Wu showed that it simplifies a technical aspect of the study of sharing; namely it rules out the recurrent issue of renaming chains, that often causes a quadratic time slowdown.
  In this paper, we define the natural abstract machine for the positive $λ$-calculus and show that it suffers from an inefficiency: the quadratic slowdown somehow reappears when analyzing the cost of the machine. We then design an optimized machine for the positive $λ$-calculus, which we prove efficient. The optimization is based on a new slicing technique which is dual to the standard structure of machine environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GG（Guaranteed Guess）是一种结合大型语言模型（LLM）和软件测试框架的ISA间代码翻译方法，显著提升了CISC到RISC的翻译效率和正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件生态系统快速发展，需要快速、灵活且正确地在不同指令集架构（ISA）间翻译低级程序，以增强代码的可移植性和寿命。

Method: GG利用预训练的LLM生成候选翻译，并通过软件测试框架量化翻译的置信度。

Result: 在HumanEval和BringupBench上分别达到99%和49%的正确率，性能优于Rosetta 2，运行速度更快、能效更高、内存占用更少。

Conclusion: GG为CISC到RISC的翻译任务提供了高效解决方案，并开源代码和数据以推动相关研究。

Abstract: The hardware ecosystem is rapidly evolving, with increasing interest in translating low-level programs across different instruction set architectures (ISAs) in a quick, flexible, and correct way to enhance the portability and longevity of existing code. A particularly challenging class of this transpilation problem is translating between complex- (CISC) and reduced- (RISC) hardware architectures, due to fundamental differences in instruction complexity, memory models, and execution paradigms. In this work, we introduce GG (Guaranteed Guess), an ISA-centric transpilation pipeline that combines the translation power of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with the rigor of established software testing constructs. Our method generates candidate translations using an LLM from one ISA to another, and embeds such translations within a software-testing framework to build quantifiable confidence in the translation. We evaluate our GG approach over two diverse datasets, enforce high code coverage (>98%) across unit tests, and achieve functional/semantic correctness of 99% on HumanEval programs and 49% on BringupBench programs, respectively. Further, we compare our approach to the state-of-the-art Rosetta 2 framework on Apple Silicon, showcasing 1.73x faster runtime performance, 1.47x better energy efficiency, and 2.41x better memory usage for our transpiled code, demonstrating the effectiveness of GG for real-world CISC-to-RISC translation tasks. We will open-source our codes, data, models, and benchmarks to establish a common foundation for ISA-level code translation research.
