It is typically embedded into a general-purpose language. There exists a plethora of implementations for numerous host languages. However, the existing implementations often re-invent the method of embedding, which impedes maintenance and weakens assertions of correctness. To formalize and thereby unify the embedding of a ground subset of CHR into arbitrary host languages, we introduced the framework FreeCHR and proved it to be a valid representation of classical CHR. For the sake of simplicity, abstract implementations of our framework did not yet include a concrete matching algorithm nor optimizations. In this paper, we introduce an improved execution algorithm for FreeCHR. We also provide an evaluation of the algorithm via benchmarks which suggest the effectiveness of our implemented optimizations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86FreeCHR\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u6267\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CHR\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cd\u590d\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u9700\u7edf\u4e00\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684FreeCHR\u6267\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6539\u8fdb\u7684FreeCHR\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3aCHR\u5d4c\u5165\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Accattoli and Wu showed that it simplifies a technical aspect of the study of sharing; namely it rules out the recurrent issue of renaming chains, that often causes a quadratic time slowdown.\n  In this paper, we define the natural abstract machine for the positive $\u03bb$-calculus and show that it suffers from an inefficiency: the quadratic slowdown somehow reappears when analyzing the cost of the machine. We then design an optimized machine for the positive $\u03bb$-calculus, which we prove efficient. The optimization is based on a new slicing technique which is dual to the standard structure of machine environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Wu\u7684\u6b63\u03bb\u6f14\u7b97\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u5171\u4eab\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u6280\u672f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u62bd\u8c61\u673a\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u673a\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Wu\u7684\u6b63\u03bb\u6f14\u7b97\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u673a\u5668\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u81ea\u7136\u62bd\u8c61\u673a\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b0\u5207\u7247\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u673a\u5668\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4e8c\u6b21\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u5207\u7247\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5668\u5728\u6b63\u03bb\u6f14\u7b97\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u3002"}}

A particularly challenging class of this transpilation problem is translating between complex- (CISC) and reduced- (RISC) hardware architectures, due to fundamental differences in instruction complexity, memory models, and execution paradigms. In this work, we introduce GG (Guaranteed Guess), an ISA-centric transpilation pipeline that combines the translation power of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with the rigor of established software testing constructs. Our method generates candidate translations using an LLM from one ISA to another, and embeds such translations within a software-testing framework to build quantifiable confidence in the translation. We evaluate our GG approach over two diverse datasets, enforce high code coverage (>98%) across unit tests, and achieve functional/semantic correctness of 99% on HumanEval programs and 49% on BringupBench programs, respectively. Further, we compare our approach to the state-of-the-art Rosetta 2 framework on Apple Silicon, showcasing 1.73x faster runtime performance, 1.47x better energy efficiency, and 2.41x better memory usage for our transpiled code, demonstrating the effectiveness of GG for real-world CISC-to-RISC translation tasks. We will open-source our codes, data, models, and benchmarks to establish a common foundation for ISA-level code translation research.", "AI": {"tldr": "GG\uff08Guaranteed Guess\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\u7684ISA\u95f4\u4ee3\u7801\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86CISC\u5230RISC\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u786c\u4ef6\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6307\u4ee4\u96c6\u67b6\u6784\uff08ISA\uff09\u95f4\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\u548c\u5bff\u547d\u3002", "method": "GG\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684LLM\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\u91cf\u5316\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728HumanEval\u548cBringupBench\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523099%\u548c49%\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8eRosetta 2\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u80fd\u6548\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "GG\u4e3aCISC\u5230RISC\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}
