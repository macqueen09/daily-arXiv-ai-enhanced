Conclusion: MoLE在多语言编程中实现了效率与性能的平衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
aiding developers with tasks like code comprehension, generation, and
translation. Supporting multilingual programming -- i.e., coding tasks across
multiple programming languages -- typically requires either (1) finetuning a
single LLM across all programming languages, which is cost-efficient but
sacrifices language-specific specialization and performance, or (2) finetuning
separate LLMs for each programming language, which allows for specialization
but is computationally expensive and storage-intensive due to the duplication
of parameters. This paper introduces MoLE (Mix-of-Language-Experts), a novel
architecture that balances efficiency and specialization for multilingual
programming. MoLE is composed of a base model, a shared LoRA (low-rank
adaptation) module, and a collection of language-specific LoRA modules. These
modules are jointly optimized during the finetuning process, enabling effective
knowledge sharing and specialization across programming languages. During
inference, MoLE automatically routes to the language-specific LoRA module
corresponding to the programming language of the code token being generated.
Our experiments demonstrate that MoLE achieves greater parameter efficiency
compared to training separate language-specific LoRAs, while outperforming a
single shared LLM finetuned for all programming languages in terms of accuracy.

### [2] [The Autonomous Data Language -- Concepts, Design and Formal Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19457)
*Tom T. P. Franken,Thomas Neele,Jan Friso Groote*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的并行编程范式——数据自治范式，其中计算由自治数据元素执行，并介绍了首个数据自治编程语言AuDaLa及其形式化定义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前并行语言主要关注处理器和线程，导致数据处理复杂，与原始算法脱节，因此需要一种更自然的数据协作方式。

Method: 提出数据自治范式，开发AuDaLa语言，包括类型系统和操作语义，并通过示例展示其编程风格。

Result: AuDaLa编程更自然，支持并行程序的形式化验证。

Conclusion: 数据自治范式为并行编程提供了新思路，AuDaLa语言展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Nowadays, the main advances in computational power are due to parallelism.
However, most parallel languages have been designed with a focus on processors
and threads. This makes dealing with data and memory in programs hard, which
distances the implementation from its original algorithm. We propose a new
paradigm for parallel programming, the data-autonomous paradigm, where
computation is performed by autonomous data elements. Programs in this paradigm
are focused on making the data collaborate in a highly parallel fashion. We
furthermore present AuDaLa, the first data autonomous programming language, and
provide a full formalisation that includes a type system and operational
semantics. Programming in AuDaLa is very natural, as illustrated by examples,
albeit in a style very different from sequential and contemporary parallel
programming. Additionally, it lends itself for the formal verification of
parallel programs, which we demonstrate.
