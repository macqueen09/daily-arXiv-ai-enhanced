### [1] [Can Large Language Models Help Students Prove Software Correctness? An Experimental Study with Dafny](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22370)
*Carolina Carreira,Álvaro Silva,Alexandre Abreu,Alexandra Mendes*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究探讨学生在形式化验证任务中使用ChatGPT的效果，发现其显著提升表现，但效果依赖于提示质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解大语言模型（如ChatGPT）如何支持学生在高认知需求任务（如程序验证）中的学习。

Method: 通过混合方法研究，让硕士生在Dafny语言中完成验证问题，一组使用ChatGPT，另一组不用，记录交互并分析策略。

Result: 使用ChatGPT的学生表现显著更好，但表现提升与提示质量相关。

Conclusion: 建议在形式化方法课程中更有效地整合LLM，设计促进学习的LLM感知挑战。

Abstract: Students in computing education increasingly use large language models (LLMs)
such as ChatGPT. Yet, the role of LLMs in supporting cognitively demanding
tasks, like deductive program verification, remains poorly understood. This
paper investigates how students interact with an LLM when solving formal
verification exercises in Dafny, a language that supports functional
correctness, by allowing programmers to write formal specifications and
automatically verifying that the implementation satisfies the specification. We
conducted a mixed-methods study with master's students enrolled in a formal
methods course. Each participant completed two verification problems, one with
access to a custom ChatGPT interface, that logged all interactions, and the
other without. We identified strategies used by successful students and
assessed the level of trust students place in LLMs. %\todo{Our findings show
that something here} Our findings show that students perform significantly
better when using ChatGPT; however, performance gains are tied to prompt
quality. We conclude with practical recommendations for integrating LLMs into
formal methods courses more effectively, including designing LLM-aware
challenges that promote learning rather than substitution.

### [2] [MCFuser: High-Performance and Rapid Fusion of Memory-Bound Compute-Intensive Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22169)
*Zheng Zhang,Donglin Yang,Xiaobo Zhou,Dazhao Cheng*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: MCFuser框架通过高效融合内存受限的计算密集型算子链，显著提升GPU性能并减少调优时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多计算密集型算子融合因计算吞吐饱和而受限的问题，以及现有方法因搜索空间有限、内存访问冗余和调优时间长导致的性能不佳。

Method: 利用高级平铺表达式定义搜索空间，结合DAG分析消除冗余内存访问，通过剪枝指南和启发式搜索加速调优。

Result: 在NVIDIA A100和RTX3080 GPU上，性能提升达5.9倍，调优时间减少70倍以上。

Conclusion: MCFuser为内存受限的计算密集型算子链提供了一种高效融合方案，显著优于现有编译器。

Abstract: Operator fusion, a key technique to improve data locality and alleviate GPU
memory bandwidth pressure, often fails to extend to the fusion of multiple
compute-intensive operators due to saturated computation throughput. However,
the dynamicity of tensor dimension sizes could potentially lead to these
operators becoming memory-bound, necessitating the generation of fused kernels,
a task hindered by limited search spaces for fusion strategies, redundant
memory access, and prolonged tuning time, leading to sub-optimal performance
and inefficient deployment.
  We introduce MCFuser, a pioneering framework designed to overcome these
obstacles by generating high-performance fused kernels for what we define as
memory-bound compute-intensive (MBCI) operator chains. Leveraging high-level
tiling expressions to delineate a comprehensive search space, coupled with
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) analysis to eliminate redundant memory accesses,
MCFuser streamlines kernel optimization. By implementing guidelines to prune
the search space and incorporating an analytical performance model with a
heuristic search, MCFuser not only significantly accelerates the tuning process
but also demonstrates superior performance. Benchmarked against leading
compilers like Ansor on NVIDIA A100 and RTX3080 GPUs, MCFuser achieves up to a
5.9x speedup in kernel performance and outpaces other baselines while reducing
tuning time by over 70-fold, showcasing its agility.

### [3] [Under the Hood of BlotchyQuasar: DLL-Based RAT Campaigns Against Latin America](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22323)
*Alessio Di Santo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 针对拉丁美洲（尤其是巴西）的复杂恶意垃圾邮件活动，通过钓鱼邮件诱使用户执行恶意MSI文件，利用DLL侧加载绕过安全防御，部署变种QuasarRAT（BlotchyQuasar）窃取敏感信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 攻击者旨在窃取浏览器存储的凭证和银行信息，通过模仿巴西银行的虚假登录窗口进一步获取数据。

Method: 利用钓鱼邮件分发恶意MSI文件，通过DLL侧加载技术绕过防御，部署BlotchyQuasar进行数据窃取和持久化。

Result: 恶意软件成功窃取敏感信息并建立持久性，但因代码粗糙存在效率问题。

Conclusion: 该活动对目标地区构成严重威胁，凸显了加强网络安全防御的必要性。

Abstract: A sophisticated malspam campaign was recently uncovered targeting Latin
American countries, with a particular focus on Brazil. This operation utilizes
a highly deceptive phishing email to trick users into executing a malicious MSI
file, initiating a multi-stage infection. The core of the attack leverages DLL
side-loading, where a legitimate executable from Valve Corporation is used to
load a trojanized DLL, thereby bypassing standard security defenses.
  Once active, the malware, a variant of QuasarRAT known as BlotchyQuasar, is
capable of a wide range of malicious activities. It is designed to steal
sensitive browser-stored credentials and banking information, the latter
through fake login windows mimicking well-known Brazilian banks. The threat
establishes persistence by modifying the Windows registry , captures user
keystrokes through keylogging , and exfiltrates stolen data to a
Command-and-Control (C2) server using encrypted payloads. Despite its advanced
capabilities, the malware code exhibits signs of rushed development, with
inefficiencies and poor error handling that suggest the threat actors
prioritized rapid deployment over meticulous design. Nonetheless, the campaign
extensive reach and sophisticated mechanisms pose a serious and immediate
threat to the targeted regions, underscoring the need for robust cybersecurity
defenses.
