However,\nthe dynamicity of tensor dimension sizes could potentially lead to these\noperators becoming memory-bound, necessitating the generation of fused kernels,\na task hindered by limited search spaces for fusion strategies, redundant\nmemory access, and prolonged tuning time, leading to sub-optimal performance\nand inefficient deployment.\n  We introduce MCFuser, a pioneering framework designed to overcome these\nobstacles by generating high-performance fused kernels for what we define as\nmemory-bound compute-intensive (MBCI) operator chains. Leveraging high-level\ntiling expressions to delineate a comprehensive search space, coupled with\nDirected Acyclic Graph (DAG) analysis to eliminate redundant memory accesses,\nMCFuser streamlines kernel optimization. By implementing guidelines to prune\nthe search space and incorporating an analytical performance model with a\nheuristic search, MCFuser not only significantly accelerates the tuning process\nbut also demonstrates superior performance. Benchmarked against leading\ncompilers like Ansor on NVIDIA A100 and RTX3080 GPUs, MCFuser achieves up to a\n5.9x speedup in kernel performance and outpaces other baselines while reducing\ntuning time by over 70-fold, showcasing its agility.", "AI": {"tldr": "MCFuser\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u878d\u5408\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u7b97\u5b50\u94fe\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347GPU\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8c03\u4f18\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u7b97\u5b50\u878d\u5408\u56e0\u8ba1\u7b97\u541e\u5410\u9971\u548c\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u6709\u9650\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u8c03\u4f18\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5e73\u94fa\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4e49\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408DAG\u5206\u6790\u6d88\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u526a\u679d\u6307\u5357\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u52a0\u901f\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "result": "\u5728NVIDIA A100\u548cRTX3080 GPU\u4e0a\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe5.9\u500d\uff0c\u8c03\u4f18\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1170\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "MCFuser\u4e3a\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u7b97\u5b50\u94fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u3002"}}
