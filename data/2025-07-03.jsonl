We demonstrate how strategic grammar construction can dramatically\nimprove parsing performance without modifying the underlying LPeg library. For\nthe JSON parser, we implement substitution capture and table construction\noptimization to reduce memory allocation overhead and improve object\nprocessing. For the Glob converter, we introduce segment-boundary separation,\nimplement Cox's flattened search strategy, and develop optimized braced\ncondition handling to prevent exponential backtracking. Comprehensive\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our JSON parser achieves processing speeds up to\n125 MB/s on complex documents, consistently outperforming dkjson and showing\ncompetitive results against rxi_json across most test cases. Our Glob-to-LPeg\nconverter exhibits 14-92% better performance than Bun.Glob and runs 3-14 times\nfaster than Minimatch across diverse pattern matching scenarios. This research\nprovides practical optimization techniques for LPeg-based parsers, contributing\nvaluable strategies to the text processing ecosystem."}

More precisely, in a previous\nwork a language called global was presented, whose virtue is to provide a\nconceptually clear way of introducing imperative operations in a functional\nlanguage. Memory safety is provided by the concept of linear protection, which\nconnects the global system to a linear one. In this paper we show that the\nconcept of global variable provided by the global language arises from the\nTofte and Talping's region language through the unification of abstraction and\nregion abstraction."}

LeanLTL supports reasoning about traces that represent either infinite or\nfinite linear time. The library allows traditional LTL syntax to be combined\nwith arbitrary Lean expressions, making it straightforward to define properties\ninvolving numerical or other types. We prove that standard flavors of LTL can\nbe embedded in our framework. The library also provides automation for\nreasoning about LeanLTL formulas in a way that facilitates using Lean's\nexisting tactics. Finally, we provide examples illustrating the utility of the\nlibrary in reasoning about systems that come from applications."}
