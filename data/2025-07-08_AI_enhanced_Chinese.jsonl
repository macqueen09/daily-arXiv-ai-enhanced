In contrast, formal specifications provide stronger\ncorrectness criteria for effective repairs.\n  We present an innovative APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming\nlanguage that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions,\npost-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair.\nAssuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs,\nwe localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare Logic\nto determine the state of each statement within the program and\nstate-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes.\nThe chosen models were GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B.\n  We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny\nprograms. Our tool achieves 89.6% accuracy in fault localization, with GPT-4o\nmini yielding the highest repair success rate (74.18%). These results highlight\nthe potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-driven program synthesis\nfor automated program repair.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eDafny\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\uff08APR\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u573a\u666f\u3002\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u6545\u969c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Hoare\u903b\u8f91\u5206\u6790\u7a0b\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\uff08\u5982GPT-4o mini\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7b97\u672f\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "\u5728DafnyBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a89.6%\uff0cGPT-4o mini\u4fee\u590d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe74.18%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4e0eLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, current approaches face\na critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional\ncorrectness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA). Methods\nbased on supervised fine-tuning often generate functionally correct but\nPPA-suboptimal code, lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles. In\ncontrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after\ngeneration are often inefficient because they operate externally without\nupdating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic\ndesign capabilities.\n  To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven\nreinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that\nachieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1\nemploys a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on\nsyntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from\nsynthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn\ncomplex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code\nthat is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on\nstandard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results\nin functional correctness.
