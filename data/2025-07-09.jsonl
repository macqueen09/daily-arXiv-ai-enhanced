Unfortunately, the current\npractice for constructing such neurosymbolic AR systems is an ad hoc\nprogramming model that does not have the strong guarantees of traditional\nsymbolic algorithms, nor a deep enough synchronization of neural networks and\nsymbolic reasoning to unlock the full potential of LLM-powered reasoning. I\npropose Neurosymbolic Transition Systems as a principled computational model\nthat can underlie infrastructure for building neurosymbolic AR tools. In this\nmodel, symbolic state is paired with intuition, and state transitions operate\nover symbols and intuition in parallel. I argue why this new paradigm can scale\nlogical reasoning beyond current capabilities while retaining the strong\nguarantees of symbolic algorithms, and I sketch out how the computational model\nI propose can be reified in a logic programming language."}
