### [1] [Pyrosome: Verified Compilation for Modular Metatheory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06360)
*Dustin Jamner,Gabriel Kammer,Ritam Nag,Adam Chlipala*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Pyrosome是一个模块化语言元理论的通用框架，支持可扩展语义和编译，通过Coq实现。其核心创新是支持语言、目标语言和编译器的新规则添加的等价性保持归纳形式化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语义推理技术通常与特定语言和编译器结构紧密耦合，缺乏灵活性。Pyrosome旨在提供一种可扩展的框架，使得语言扩展（如新效果）只需定义和验证新特性，同时复用原有正确性定理。

Method: Pyrosome通过依赖排序的等式理论定义编程语言的深层嵌入形式，所有编译器正确性证明归结为类型检查和等式推理。支持垂直组合和特性扩展。

Result: 案例研究展示了从System F到CPS翻译和闭包转换的多阶段编译器构建，通过逐步扩展特性（如自然数、递归函数、全局堆等）并复用原有定理。还支持线性类型和命令式特性。

Conclusion: Pyrosome提供了一种灵活且可扩展的语言元理论框架，支持模块化扩展和验证，适用于复杂语言特性的逐步构建和验证。

Abstract: We present Pyrosome, a generic framework for modular language metatheory that
embodies a novel approach to extensible semantics and compilation, implemented
in Coq. Common techniques for semantic reasoning are often tied to the specific
structures of the languages and compilers that they support. In Pyrosome,
verified compilers are fully extensible, meaning that to extend a language
(even with a new kind of effect) simply requires defining and verifying the
compilation of the new feature, reusing the old correctness theorem for all
other cases. The novel enabling idea is an inductive formulation of equivalence
preservation that supports the addition of new rules to the source language,
target language, and compiler.
  Pyrosome defines a formal, deeply embedded notion of programming languages
with semantics given by dependently sorted equational theories, so all
compiler-correctness proofs boil down to type-checking and equational
reasoning. We support vertical composition of any compilers expressed in our
framework in addition to feature extension. As a case study, we present a
multipass compiler from System F with simple references, through CPS
translation and closure conversion. Specifically, we demonstrate how we can
build such a compiler incrementally by starting with a compiler for simply
typed lambda-calculus and adding natural numbers, the unit type, recursive
functions, and a global heap, then extending judgments with a type environment
and adding type abstraction, all while reusing the original theorems. We also
present a linear version of the simply typed CPS pass and compile a small
imperative language to the simply typed target to show how Pyrosome handles
substructural typing and imperative features.

### [2] [Fast Collection Operations from Indexed Stream Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06456)
*Scott Kovach,Praneeth Kolichala,Kyle A. Miller,David Broman,Fredrik Kjolstad*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效遍历和组合关联集合数据结构的系统，无需专用编译器或分阶段编译即可实现高效性和可组合性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迭代器库需要专用编译器支持，限制了效率和可组合性，本系统旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 基于索引流的表示方法，避免中间分配，支持复杂连接操作。

Result: 在Lean、Morphic和Rust中实现，并在Lean中提供了功能正确性的机械化证明。

Conclusion: 该系统展示了无需专用编译器即可高效处理关联集合的可行性。

Abstract: We present a system of efficient methods for traversing and combining
associative collection data structures. A distinguishing feature of the system
is that, like traditional sequential iterator libraries, it does not require
specialized compiler infrastructure or staged compilation for efficiency and
composability. By using a representation based on indexed streams, the library
can express complex joins over input collections while using no intermediate
allocations. We implement the library for the Lean, Morphic, and Rust
programming languages and provide a mechanized proof of functional correctness
in Lean.

### [3] [Finding Compiler Bugs through Cross-Language Code Generator and Differential Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06584)
*Qiong Feng,Xiaotian Ma,Ziyuan Feng,Marat Akhin,Wei Song,Peng Liang*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文提出CrossLangFuzzer框架，通过通用中间表示和程序变异技术，发现并诊断跨语言编译中的编译器错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言编译的正确性研究不足，现有工作多关注单语言编译验证。

Method: 提出基于JVM语言的通用中间表示，并应用三种变异技术（LangShuffler、FunctionRemoval、TypeChanger）生成多样化测试程序。

Result: 发现多个编译器中的24个错误，其中TypeChanger最有效。

Conclusion: 首次针对跨语言编译错误进行研究，为多语言环境下的编译器正确性提供改进方向。

Abstract: Compilers play a central role in translating high-level code into executable
programs, making their correctness essential for ensuring code safety and
reliability. While extensive research has focused on verifying the correctness
of compilers for single-language compilation, the correctness of cross-language
compilation - which involves the interaction between two languages and their
respective compilers - remains largely unexplored. To fill this research gap,
we propose CrossLangFuzzer, a novel framework that introduces a universal
intermediate representation (IR) for JVM-based languages and automatically
generates cross-language test programs with diverse type parameters and complex
inheritance structures. After generating the initial IR, CrossLangFuzzer
applies three mutation techniques - LangShuffler, FunctionRemoval, and
TypeChanger - to enhance program diversity. By evaluating both the original and
mutated programs across multiple compiler versions, CrossLangFuzzer
successfully uncovered 10 confirmed bugs in the Kotlin compiler, 4 confirmed
bugs in the Groovy compiler, 7 confirmed bugs in the Scala 3 compiler, 2
confirmed bugs in the Scala 2 compiler, and 1 confirmed bug in the Java
compiler. Among all mutators, TypeChanger is the most effective, detecting 11
of the 24 compiler bugs. Furthermore, we analyze the symptoms and root causes
of cross-compilation bugs, examining the respective responsibilities of
language compilers when incorrect behavior occurs during cross-language
compilation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the firstwork specifically
focused on identifying and diagnosing compiler bugs in cross-language
compilation scenarios. Our research helps to understand these challenges and
contributes to improving compiler correctness in multi-language environments.

### [4] [Sound Interval-Based Synthesis for Probabilistic Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06939)
*Guilherme Espada,Alcides Fonseca*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于类型系统的自动选择概率模型的方法，包括类型系统、类型导向的合成算法和启发式搜索，显著优于随机搜索和现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率编程需要统计专业知识选择模型，限制了非专家用户的使用。自动模型选择因搜索空间大和无效程序多而具有挑战性。

Method: 设计类型系统静态拒绝无效程序，开发类型导向的合成算法确保程序类型安全，并采用启发式搜索处理大搜索空间。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在复杂程序上显著优于随机搜索和DaPPer方法，支持快速采样和遗传编程等技术的应用。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了概率编程中模型自动选择的挑战，为非专家用户提供了更便捷的工具。

Abstract: Probabilistic programming has become a standard practice to model stochastic
events and learn about the behavior of nature in different scientific contexts,
ranging from Genetics and Ecology to Linguistics and Psychology. However,
domain practitioners (such as biologists) also need to be experts in statistics
in order to select which probabilistic model is suitable for a given particular
problem, relying then on probabilistic inference engines such as Stan, Pyro or
Edward to fine-tune the parameters of that particular model. Probabilistic
Programming would be more useful if the model selection is made automatic,
without requiring statistics expertise from the end user. Automatically
selecting the model is challenging because of the large search space of
probabilistic programs needed to be explored, because the fact that most of
that search space contains invalid programs, and because invalid programs may
only be detected in some executions, due to its probabilistic nature. We
propose a type system to statically reject invalid probabilistic programs, a
type-directed synthesis algorithm that guarantees that generated programs are
type-safe by construction, and an heuristic search procedure to handle the vast
search space. We collect a number of probabilistic programs from the
literature, and use them to compare our method with both a type-agnostic random
search, and a data-guided method from the literature (DaPPer). Our results show
that our technique both outperforms random search and DaPPer, specially on more
complex programs. This drastic performance difference in synthesis allows for
fast sampling of programs and enables techniques that previously suffered from
the complexity of synthesis, such as Genetic Programming, to be applied.

### [5] [Representing Prompting Patterns with PDL: Compliance Agent Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06396)
*Mandana Vaziri,Louis Mandel,Yuji Watanabe,Hirokuni Kitahara,Martin Hirzel,Anca Sailer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Prompt Declaration Language (PDL)，一种新型的提示表示方法，旨在解决现有框架在灵活性和复杂性上的不足，并通过案例研究展示了其性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示工程框架要么过于复杂，要么缺乏灵活性，难以支持高级代理编程需求。

Method: 提出PDL，将提示置于首要位置，支持手动和自动提示调优，并整合LLM调用、规则代码和外部工具。

Result: 通过合规代理的案例研究，PDL的性能比传统方法提升了4倍。

Conclusion: PDL通过声明式表示和优化潜力，显著提升了程序员生产力和代理性能。

Abstract: Prompt engineering for LLMs remains complex, with existing frameworks either
hiding complexity behind restrictive APIs or providing inflexible canned
patterns that resist customization -- making sophisticated agentic programming
challenging. We present the Prompt Declaration Language (PDL), a novel approach
to prompt representation that tackles this fundamental complexity by bringing
prompts to the forefront, enabling manual and automatic prompt tuning while
capturing the composition of LLM calls together with rule-based code and
external tools. By abstracting away the plumbing for such compositions, PDL
aims at improving programmer productivity while providing a declarative
representation that is amenable to optimization. This paper demonstrates PDL's
utility through a real-world case study of a compliance agent. Tuning the
prompting pattern of this agent yielded up to 4x performance improvement
compared to using a canned agent and prompt pattern.
