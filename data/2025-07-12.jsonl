However, if we abstract away the\nsemantics of statements, then this problem becomes not just decidable, but\npractically feasible. For instance, a program of the form \"if $b$ then $e$ else\n$f$\" should be equivalent to \"if not $b$ then $f$ else $e$\" - no matter what\n$b$, $e$ and $f$ are. This kind of equivalence is known as propositional\nequivalence. In this extended abstract, we discuss recent developments in\npropositional program equivalence from the perspective of (Guarded) Kleene\nAlgebra with Tests, or (G)KAT."}
