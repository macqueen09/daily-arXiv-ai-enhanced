### [1] [Dependent Multiplicities in Dependent Linear Type Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08759)
*Maximilian Doré*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型依赖线性类型理论，支持变量使用次数依赖其他变量，为高阶函数提供精确资源标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统无法为某些高阶函数提供精确的资源标注，需要一种支持依赖多重性的类型理论。

Method: 通过将线性逻辑嵌入依赖类型理论，并定义其与宿主理论的交互，利用自然数类型实现依赖多重性的定量类型系统。

Result: 理论语义结合了依赖类型理论和线性逻辑的标准模型，并在Agda中实现。

Conclusion: 该理论可扩展至任何依赖类型语言，为高阶函数提供更精确的资源管理。

Abstract: We present a novel dependent linear type theory in which the multiplicity of
some variable - i.e., the number of times the variable can be used in a program
- can depend on other variables. This allows us to give precise resource
annotations to many higher-order functions that cannot be adequately typed in
any other system. Inspired by the Dialectica translation, our typing discipline
is obtained by embedding linear logic into dependent type theory and specifying
how the embedded logic interacts with the host theory. We can then use a
standard natural numbers type to obtain a quantitative typing system with
dependent multiplicities. We characterise the semantics for our theory as a
combination of standard models of dependent type theory and linear logic. Our
system can be added to any dependently typed language, which we demonstrate
with an implementation in Agda.

*Owen Lewis,Neil Ghani,Andrew Dudzik,Christos Perivolaropoulos,Razvan Pascanu,Petar Veličković*

Main category: cs.PL

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何定义“好”的外推函数，特别是在列表函数中遵循规则的行为，以解决外推问题的不确定性。

Method: 引入过滤等变函数的概念，证明其基本定理，并与映射等变函数关联，同时提供几何解释和构造算法。

Result: 展示了过滤等变函数的示例、基本定理、几何对应关系，并提出了完美外推的构造算法。

Conclusion: 过滤等变函数为外推问题提供了有效的解决方案，其几何和算法特性为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: What should a function that extrapolates beyond known input/output examples
look like? This is a tricky question to answer in general, as any function
matching the outputs on those examples can in principle be a correct
extrapolant. We argue that a "good" extrapolant should follow certain kinds of
rules, and here we study a particularly appealing criterion for rule-following
in list functions: that the function should behave predictably even when
certain elements are removed. In functional programming, a standard way to
express such removal operations is by using a filter function. Accordingly, our
paper introduces a new semantic class of functions -- the filter equivariant
functions. We show that this class contains interesting examples, prove some
basic theorems about it, and relate it to the well-known class of map
equivariant functions. We also present a geometric account of filter
equivariants, showing how they correspond naturally to certain simplicial
structures. Our highlight result is the amalgamation algorithm, which
constructs any filter-equivariant function's output by first studying how it
behaves on sublists of the input, in a way that extrapolates perfectly.

### [3] [Heterogeneous Dynamic Logic: Provability Modulo Program Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08581)
*Samuel Teuber,Mattias Ulbrich,André Platzer,Bernhard Beckert*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为异构动态逻辑（HDL）的框架，用于模块化和组合地结合不同程序逻辑的推理原则，支持多语言系统的形式化验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言系统的形式化验证具有挑战性，需要一种能够灵活组合不同程序逻辑的方法。

Method: HDL框架通过动态理论的提升和组合操作，支持跨语言推理，并在Isabelle中形式化验证其正确性。

Result: 证明了提升和组合操作的相对完备性，并通过汽车案例展示了HDL的实际应用。

Conclusion: HDL为多语言系统的形式化验证提供了一种模块化和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Formally specifying, let alone verifying, properties of systems involving
multiple programming languages is inherently challenging. We introduce
Heterogeneous Dynamic Logic (HDL), a framework for combining reasoning
principles from distinct (dynamic) program logics in a modular and
compositional way. HDL mirrors the architecture of satisfiability modulo
theories (SMT): Individual dynamic logics, along with their calculi, are
treated as dynamic theories that can be flexibly combined to reason about
heterogeneous systems whose components are verified using different program
logics. HDL provides two key operations: Lifting extends an individual dynamic
theory with new program constructs (e.g., the havoc operation or regular
programs) and automatically augments its calculus with sound reasoning
principles for the new constructs; and Combination enables cross-language
reasoning in a single modality via Heterogeneous Dynamic Theories, facilitating
the reuse of existing proof infrastructure. We formalize dynamic theories,
their lifting and combination in Isabelle, and prove the soundness of all proof
rules. We also prove relative completeness theorems for lifting and
combination: Under common assumptions, reasoning about lifted or combined
theories is no harder than reasoning about the constituent dynamic theories and
their common first-order structure (i.e., the "data theory"). We demonstrate
HDL's utility by verifying an automotive case study in which a Java controller
(formalized in Java dynamic logic) steers a plant model (formalized in
differential dynamic logic).
