This allows us to give precise resource\nannotations to many higher-order functions that cannot be adequately typed in\nany other system. Inspired by the Dialectica translation, our typing discipline\nis obtained by embedding linear logic into dependent type theory and specifying\nhow the embedded logic interacts with the host theory. We can then use a\nstandard natural numbers type to obtain a quantitative typing system with\ndependent multiplicities. We characterise the semantics for our theory as a\ncombination of standard models of dependent type theory and linear logic.

This is a tricky question to answer in general, as any function\nmatching the outputs on those examples can in principle be a correct\nextrapolant. We argue that a \"good\" extrapolant should follow certain kinds of\nrules, and here we study a particularly appealing criterion for rule-following\nin list functions: that the function should behave predictably even when\ncertain elements are removed. In functional programming, a standard way to\nexpress such removal operations is by using a filter function. Accordingly, our\npaper introduces a new semantic class of functions -- the filter equivariant\nfunctions. We show that this class contains interesting examples, prove some\nbasic theorems about it, and relate it to the well-known class of map\nequivariant functions. We also present a geometric account of filter\nequivariants, showing how they correspond naturally to certain simplicial\nstructures.

We formalize dynamic theories,\ntheir lifting and combination in Isabelle, and prove the soundness of all proof\nrules.
