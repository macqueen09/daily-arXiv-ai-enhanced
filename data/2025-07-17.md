Conclusion: 该语言为量子编程提供了更抽象和结构化的方法，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Quantum programs today are written at a low level of abstraction - quantum
circuits akin to assembly languages - and even advanced quantum programming
languages essentially function as circuit description languages. This state of
affairs impedes scalability, clarity, and support for higher-level reasoning.
More abstract and expressive quantum programming constructs are needed.
  To this end, we introduce a novel yet simple quantum programming language for
generating unitaries from "just a phase"; we combine a (global) phase operation
that captures phase shifts with a quantum analogue of the "if let" construct
that captures subspace selection via pattern matching. This minimal language
lifts the focus from quantum gates to eigendecomposition, conjugation, and
controlled unitaries; common building blocks in quantum algorithm design.
  We demonstrate several aspects of the expressive power of our language in
several ways. Firstly, we establish that our representation is universal by
deriving a universal quantum gate set. Secondly, we show that important quantum
algorithms can be expressed naturally and concisely, including Grover's search
algorithm, Hamiltonian simulation, Quantum Fourier Transform, Quantum Signal
Processing, and the Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation. Furthermore, we give
clean denotational semantics grounded in categorical quantum mechanics.
Finally, we implement a prototype compiler that efficiently translates terms of
our language to quantum circuits, and prove that it is sound with respect to
these semantics. Collectively, these contributions show that this construct
offers a principled and practical step toward more abstract and structured
quantum programming.

### [2] [Picat Through the Lens of Advent of Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11731)
*Neng-Fa Zhou,Cristian Grozea,Håkan Kjellerstrand,Oisín Mac Fhearaí*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文展示了Picat语言如何高效解决2024 Advent of Code问题，特别适合逆向工程和路径查找等任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Picat语言在解决复杂问题时的优势，尤其是其内置约束求解和动态编程功能。

Method: 使用Picat的SAT约束求解和表格化功能，实现简洁且高效的解决方案。

Result: Picat能够以声明式方式高效解决问题，相比命令式语言更省力。

Conclusion: Picat的多范式特性使其在特定类型问题中表现卓越。

Abstract: Picat is a logic-based, multi-paradigm programming language that integrates
features from logic, functional, constraint, and imperative programming
paradigms. This paper presents solutions to several problems from the 2024
Advent of Code (AoC). While AoC problems are not designed for any specific
programming language, certain problem types, such as reverse engineering and
path-finding, are particularly well-suited to Picat due to its built-in
constraint solving, pattern matching, backtracking, and dynamic programming
with tabling. This paper demonstrates that Picat's features, especially its
SAT-based constraint solving and tabling, enable concise, declarative, and
highly efficient implementations of problems that would require significantly
more effort in imperative languages.

### [3] [Universal Synthesis of Differentiably Tunable Numerical Abstract Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11827)
*Shaurya Gomber,Debangshu Banerjee,Gagandeep Singh*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用变换器合成算法，用于构建多面体数值域的抽象变换器家族，解决了现有方法依赖手工定制变换器的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数值抽象解释器依赖手工定制的指令特定变换器，限制了扩展性和组合推理能力，无法适应不同下游任务的需求。

Method: 提出了一种通用变换器合成算法，支持为多面体数值域和二次有界守卫操作符（QGO）构建参数化变换器家族，并引入自适应梯度引导（AGG）策略优化搜索过程。

Result: 在Zones、Octagons和Polyhedra三个数值抽象域上的实验表明，USTAD框架能够构建有效的变换器家族，并显著提升精度。

Conclusion: 通用变换器合成算法解决了现有方法的局限性，通过组合推理和梯度引导搜索实现了高精度和灵活性。

Abstract: Numerical abstract interpretation is a widely used framework for the static
analysis of numerical programs. However, existing numerical abstract
interpreters rely on hand-crafted, instruction-specific transformers tailored
to each domain, with no general algorithm for handling common operations across
domains. This limits extensibility, prevents precise compositional reasoning
over instruction sequences, and forces all downstream tasks to use the same
fixed transformer regardless of their precision, efficiency, or task-specific
requirements. To address these limitations, we propose a universal transformer
synthesis algorithm that constructs a parametric family of sound abstract
transformers for any given polyhedral numerical domain and a concrete operator
from the class of Quadratic-Bounded Guarded Operators (QGO), which includes
both individual instructions and structured sequences. Each instantiation in
this family is sound by construction, enabling downstream analyses to adapt the
transformer to their particular needs. The space of transformers is
differentiable but complex. To efficiently explore this space of transformers,
we introduce the Adaptive Gradient Guidance (AGG) procedure, a gradient-guided
search strategy that steers the search process based on downstream analysis
objectives and runtime constraints. We implement these ideas in the USTAD
framework and evaluate their effectiveness across three numerical abstract
domains: Zones, Octagons, and Polyhedra. Our results demonstrate that the
universal synthesis algorithm successfully constructs sound families of
transformers across domains, and that USTAD achieves significant, tunable
precision gains over baselines by leveraging compositional reasoning and
efficient gradient-guided traversal of the transformer space.

### [4] [Towards Relational Contextual Equality Saturation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11897)
*Tyler Hou,Shadaj Laddad,Joseph M. Hellerstein*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了将上下文等式饱和技术扩展到关系模型中的挑战和应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何将上下文等式饱和技术应用于关系模型，以支持更复杂的程序优化。

Method: 总结了现有的上下文等式饱和方法，并探讨了其在关系模型中的扩展。

Result: 提出了将上下文等式饱和与关系模型结合的关键挑战。

Conclusion: 本文为上下文等式饱和在关系模型中的应用提供了理论基础和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Equality saturation is a powerful technique for program optimization.
Contextual equality saturation extends this to support rewrite rules that are
conditioned on where a term appears in an expression. Existing work has brought
contextual reasoning to egg; in this paper, we share our ongoing work to extend
this to relational equality saturation in egglog. We summarize the existing
approaches to contextual equality saturation, outline its main applications,
and identify key challenges in combining this approach with relational models.

### [5] [Syntax Repair as Language Intersection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11873)
*Breandan Considine*

Main category: cs.FL

TL;DR: 提出一种修复任意上下文无关语言语法错误的新技术，通过语言交集问题建模，证明在有限编辑距离内生成所有有效修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语法修复问题，利用形式语言理论与程序分析的联系，提供高效修复方法。

Method: 将语法修复建模为语言交集问题，利用Bar-Hillel构造和CFL可达性理论，提出基于Brzozowski导数的枚举算法。

Result: 算法在Python语法修复基准测试中达到最优效果。

Conclusion: 该技术高效且实用，为语法修复提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce a new technique for repairing syntax errors in arbitrary
context-free languages. This technique models syntax repair as a language
intersection problem by defining a finite language that provably generates
every syntactically valid repair within a given edit distance. Leveraging a
theoretical connection between the Bar-Hillel construction from formal language
theory and CFL reachability from program analysis, we show that repairability
in a finite number of typographic edits is polylogarithmic parallel time
decidable and provide an enumeration algorithm based on the Brzozowski
derivative. Finally, we evaluate this algorithm and its implementation,
demonstrating state-of-the-art results on a Python syntax repair benchmark.

### [6] [LLM-Based Config Synthesis requires Disambiguation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12443)
*Rajdeep Mondal,Nikolaj Bjorner,Todd Millstein,Alan Tang,George Varghese*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLM在程序合成中用户意图模糊的问题，提出了一种原型系统Clarify，通过Disambiguator模块帮助明确用户意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在程序合成中常因用户意图模糊导致配置错误，特别是在网络配置（如路由映射和ACL）中，优先级问题尤为突出。

Method: 提出Clarify系统，结合LLM和Disambiguator模块，通过用户交互明确意图，并验证合成结果。

Result: 在小型合成工作负载上，Clarify成功解决了优先级模糊问题，合成了正确的路由策略。

Conclusion: Clarify的方法不仅适用于网络配置，还可推广到其他LLM合成任务中，解决意图模糊导致的全局行为差异。

Abstract: Beyond hallucinations, another problem in program synthesis using LLMs is
ambiguity in user intent. We illustrate the ambiguity problem in a networking
context for LLM-based incremental configuration synthesis of route-maps and
ACLs. These structures frequently overlap in header space, making the relative
priority of actions impossible for the LLM to infer without user interaction.
Measurements in a large cloud identify complex ACLs with 100's of overlaps,
showing ambiguity is a real problem. We propose a prototype system, Clarify,
which uses an LLM augmented with a new module called a Disambiguator that helps
elicit user intent. On a small synthetic workload, Clarify incrementally
synthesizes routing policies after disambiguation and then verifies them. Our
treatment of ambiguities is useful more generally when the intent of updates
can be correctly synthesized by LLMs, but their integration is ambiguous and
can lead to different global behaviors.

### [7] [GitChameleon: Evaluating AI Code Generation Against Python Library Version Incompatibilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12367)
*Diganta Misra,Nizar Islah,Victor May,Brice Rauby,Zihan Wang,Justine Gehring,Antonio Orvieto,Muawiz Chaudhary,Eilif B. Muller,Irina Rish,Samira Ebrahimi Kahou,Massimo Caccia*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GitChameleon是一个新的数据集，用于评估AI在特定库版本下生成可执行代码的能力，现有模型表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决软件库快速更新对代码生成的挑战，缺乏基于执行的版本兼容性评估。

Method: 创建包含328个Python代码完成问题的数据集，附带单元测试，评估LLMs等工具的功能准确性。

Result: 现有模型在任务中表现较差，企业模型成功率仅为48-51%。

Conclusion: GitChameleon为动态代码库的挑战提供了基准，推动更可靠的AI代码生成方法发展。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of software libraries poses a considerable hurdle for
code generation, necessitating continuous adaptation to frequent version
updates while preserving backward compatibility. While existing code evolution
benchmarks provide valuable insights, they typically lack execution-based
evaluation for generating code compliant with specific library versions. To
address this, we introduce GitChameleon, a novel, meticulously curated dataset
comprising 328 Python code completion problems, each conditioned on specific
library versions and accompanied by executable unit tests. GitChameleon
rigorously evaluates the capacity of contemporary large language models (LLMs),
LLM-powered agents, code assistants, and RAG systems to perform
version-conditioned code generation that demonstrates functional accuracy
through execution. Our extensive evaluations indicate that state-of-the-art
systems encounter significant challenges with this task; enterprise models
achieving baseline success rates in the 48-51\% range, underscoring the
intricacy of the problem. By offering an execution-based benchmark emphasizing
the dynamic nature of code libraries, GitChameleon enables a clearer
understanding of this challenge and helps guide the development of more
adaptable and dependable AI code generation methods. We make the dataset and
evaluation code publicly available at
https://github.com/mrcabbage972/GitChameleonBenchmark.
