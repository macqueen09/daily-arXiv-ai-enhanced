### [1] [Dual-Numbers Reverse AD for Functional Array Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12640)
*Tom Smeding,Mikołaj Konarski,Simon Peyton Jones,Andrew Fitzgibbon*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对多维数组的对偶数反向模式自动微分方法，通过批量操作变换(BOT)、对偶数组提升和符号解释实现了几乎无性能开销的数组程序自动微分


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对偶数构造在前向模式自动微分中表现良好，但在反向模式自动微分中，特别是在数组程序上的实际性能表现不佳，需要改进以支持多维数组的高效自动微分

Method: 提出了一个包含三个松耦合组件的算法：(1)语义保持的向量化代码变换(批量操作变换BOT)；(2)将基本对偶数反向自动微分算法提升到主要为一阶的数组语言；(3)符号解释实现端到端编译流水线。同时支持特定的高阶数组组合子如build、gather和scatter

Result: 实现了对多维数组的一流支持，在对偶数反向模式自动微分中几乎没有性能开销。BOT能够消除输入程序中对自动微分至关重要的高阶特性，使得将对偶数提升为"对偶数组"的简单技巧能够在几乎不修改的情况下工作

Conclusion: 虽然在过程中失去了对偶数自动微分的一些良好的可泛化特性(最重要的是对高阶代码的支持)，但通过精心选择的高阶数组组合子支持和BOT的应用，成功实现了高效的多维数组自动微分

Abstract: The standard dual-numbers construction works well for forward-mode automatic
differentiation (AD) and is attractive due to its simplicity; recently, it also
has been adapted to reverse-mode AD, but practical performance, especially on
array programs, leaves a lot to be desired. In this paper we introduce
first-class support for multidimensional arrays in dual-numbers reverse-mode AD
with little to no performance overhead. The algorithm consists of three
loosely-coupled components: a semantics-preserving vectorisation code
transformation (the bulk-operation transform or BOT), a fairly straightforward
lifting of the basic dual-numbers reverse AD algorithm to a mostly first-order
array language, and symbolic interpretation to achieve an end-to-end
compilation pipeline. Unfortunately, we lose some of the nice generalisable
aspects of dual-numbers AD in the process, most importantly support for
higher-order code.
  We do support some higher-order array combinators, but only a
carefully-chosen set: 'build' (elementwise array construction), 'gather' and
'scatter'. In return, the BOT can eliminate the essential (for AD)
higher-orderness of the input program, meaning that AD gets essentially
presented with a first-order program. This allows the naive trick of lifting
dual numbers to "dual arrays" to work without much modification.

### [2] [Formal Verification for JavaScript Regular Expressions: a Proven Semantics and its Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13091)
*Aurèle Barrière,Victor Deng,Clément Pit-Claudel*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 提出了首个机械化、简洁、实用、完整且经过验证的现代正则表达式语义，支持回溯语义，并通过实际应用展示了其实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为现代正则表达式语言提供一种可靠的语义形式化方法，填补现有规范和其他形式化工作的不足。

Method: 通过证明其与ECMAScript规范的行嵌入等价性确保语义的忠实性，并展示了两个实际应用：上下文等价性概念和PikeVM算法的形式化证明。

Result: 成功捕获了完整的回溯树，记录了所有可能的匹配及其优先级，所有定义和结果已在Rocq证明助手中机械化。

Conclusion: 该语义不仅实用，还能为现代正则表达式提供更全面的形式化支持。

Abstract: We present the first mechanized, succinct, practical, complete, and
proven-faithful semantics for a modern regular expression language with
backtracking semantics. We ensure its faithfulness by proving it equivalent to
a preexisting line-by-line embedding of the official ECMAScript specification
of JavaScript regular expressions. We demonstrate its practicality by
presenting two real-world applications. First, a new notion of contextual
equivalence for modern regular expressions, which we use to prove or disprove
rewrites drawn from previous work. Second, the first formal proof of the PikeVM
algorithm used in many real-world engines. In contrast with the specification
and other formalization work, our semantics captures not only the top-priority
match, but a full backtracking tree recording all possible matches and their
respective priority. All our definitions and results have been mechanized in
the Rocq proof assistant.

### [3] [Towards Formal Verification of LLM-Generated Code from Natural Language Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13290)
*Aaron Councilman,David Fu,Aryan Gupta,Chengxiao Wang,David Grove,Yu-Xiong Wang,Vikram Adve*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种方法，通过结合形式化查询语言和验证技术，为LLM生成的代码提供正确性保证，以提升AI代码助手的使用体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的代码常存在错误且用户难以检测，因此需要一种方法确保代码正确性，以支持自然语言编程。

Method: 提出结合形式化查询语言表示用户意图，并通过符号解释器验证LLM生成的代码是否符合意图。

Result: 在21个代码生成任务中，验证器成功验证83%的正确代码，并识别出92%的错误代码。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLM生成代码的可靠性，为自然语言编程提供了可能。

Abstract: In the past few years LLMs have emerged as a tool that can aid programmers by
taking natural language descriptions and generating code based on it. However,
LLMs often generate incorrect code that users need to fix and the literature
suggests users often struggle to detect these errors. In this work we seek to
offer formal guarantees of correctness to LLM generated code; such guarantees
could improve the experience of using AI Code Assistants and potentially enable
natural language programming for users with little or no programming knowledge.
To address this challenge we propose to incorporate a formal query language
that can represent a user's intent in a formally defined but natural
language-like manner that a user can confirm matches their intent. Then, using
such a query we propose to verify LLM generated code to ensure it matches the
user's intent. We implement these ideas in our system, Astrogator, for the
Ansible programming language which includes such a formal query language, a
calculus for representing the behavior of Ansible programs, and a symbolic
interpreter which is used for the verification. On a benchmark suite of 21
code-generation tasks, our verifier is able to verify correct code in 83% of
cases and identify incorrect code in 92%.

Method: 提出MSA架构，结合语言模型实现全局相关性检索和模型合成，以及概率程序实现定制化、连贯的世界模型。

Result: MSA在人类判断数据集上表现优于纯语言模型基线，支持直接和链式思维生成。

Conclusion: MSA能够模拟人类在开放领域中的连贯推理能力，为理解和复制人类推理提供了路径。

Abstract: When faced with novel situations, people are able to marshal relevant
considerations from a wide range of background knowledge and put these to use
in inferences and predictions. What permits us to draw in globally relevant
information and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that
people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to
construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a
computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''
(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval
and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent
world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel
reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of
sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning
by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;
(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in
light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA
approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,
under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports
model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way
that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over
globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating
human reasoning in open-ended domains.
