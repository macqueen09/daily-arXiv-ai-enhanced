Conclusion: 该方法在精度、效率和自动化方面优于现有技术，适用于广泛分布类型。

Abstract: This article introduces a new approach to principled and practical random
variate generation with formal guarantees. The key idea is to first specify the
desired probability distribution in terms of a finite-precision numerical
program that defines its cumulative distribution function (CDF), and then
generate exact random variates according to this CDF. We present a universal
and fully automated method to synthesize exact random variate generators given
any numerical CDF implemented in any binary number format, such as
floating-point, fixed-point, and posits. The method is guaranteed to operate
with the same precision used to specify the CDF, does not overflow, avoids
expensive arbitrary-precision arithmetic, and exposes a consistent API. The
method rests on a novel space-time optimal implementation for the class of
generators that attain the information-theoretically optimal Knuth and Yao
entropy rate, consuming the least possible number of input random bits per
output variate. We develop a random variate generation library using our method
in C and evaluate it on a diverse set of ``continuous'' and ``discrete''
distributions, showing competitive runtime with the state-of-the-art GNU
Scientific Library while delivering higher accuracy, entropy efficiency, and
automation.

### [2] [Increasing the Expressiveness of a Gradual Verifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13533)
*Priyam Gupta*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文扩展了Gradual C0，支持展开表达式，以更直观地指定递归堆数据结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态验证虽然提供强正确性保证，但完全指定程序的过程复杂且繁琐。逐步验证旨在简化这一过程，但现有工具Gradual C0在规范语言上缺乏表现力。

Method: 设计并实现了对Gradual C0的扩展，支持展开表达式。

Result: 扩展后的工具能够更直观地指定递归堆数据结构。

Conclusion: 通过支持展开表达式，提升了逐步验证工具的实用性和表现力。

Abstract: Static verification provides strong correctness guarantees for code; however,
fully specifying programs for static verification is a complex, burdensome
process for users. Gradual verification was introduced to make this process
easier by supporting the verification of partially specified programs. The only
currently working gradual verifier, Gradual C0, successfully verifies heap
manipulating programs, but lacks expressiveness in its specification language.
This paper describes the design and implementation of an extension to Gradual
C0 that supports unfolding expressions, which allow more intuitive
specifications of recursive heap data structures.

### [3] [AdapTT: Functoriality for Dependent Type Casts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13774)
*Arthur Adjedj,Meven Lennon-Bertrand,Thibaut Benjamin,Kenji Maillard*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: AdapTT 是一种类型理论，通过抽象适配器关系类型，系统化地研究类型构造器的函子性，并推导出通用归纳类型构造器的类型转换结构规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究依赖类型理论中类型转换的共同结构行为，尤其是类型构造器的函子性。

Method: 提出 AdapTT 类型理论，利用适配器关系类型，系统化地描述类型构造器的函子性。

Result: 通过 AdapTT 的描述，推导出通用归纳类型构造器的类型转换结构规律。

Conclusion: AdapTT 提供了一种系统化的方法，用于研究和应用类型构造器的函子性及其在类型转换中的作用。

Abstract: The ability to cast values between related types is a leitmotiv of many
flavors of dependent type theory, such as observational type theories,
subtyping, or cast calculi for gradual typing. These casts all exhibit a common
structural behavior that boils down to the pervasive functoriality of type
formers. We propose and extensively study a type theory, called AdapTT, which
makes systematic and precise this idea of functorial type formers, with respect
to an abstract notion of adapters relating types. Leveraging descriptions for
functorial inductive types in AdapTT, we derive structural laws for type casts
on general inductive type formers.

### [4] [Don't exhaust, don't waste](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13792)
*Riccardo Bianchini,Francesco Dagnino,Paola Giannini,Elena Zucca*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 扩展了lambda演算的语义和类型系统，使其具备资源感知能力，确保资源不被耗尽或浪费。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为lambda演算引入资源感知能力，以跟踪资源使用情况，避免资源耗尽或浪费。

Method: 基于任意等级代数参数化扩展，无需对底层语言进行特殊修改，采用大步语义形式化。

Result: 类型系统保证在良好类型程序中存在无资源耗尽或浪费的计算路径。

Conclusion: 通过共归纳推理技术，成功实现了资源感知的语义和类型系统的形式化与验证。

Abstract: We extend the semantics and type system of a lambda calculus equipped with
common constructs to be resource-aware. That is, the semantics keep tracks of
the usage of resources, and is stuck, besides in case of type errors, if either
a needed resource is exhausted, or a provided resource would be wasted. In such
way, the type system guarantees, besides standard soundness, that for
well-typed programs there is a computation where no resource gets either
exhausted or wasted.
  The no-waste extension is parametric on an arbitrary grade algebra, modeling
an arbitrary assortment of possible usages, and does not require ad-hoc changes
to the underlying language. To this end, the semantics needs to be formalized
in big-step style; as a consequence, expressing and proving (resource-aware)
soundness is challenging, and is achieved by applying recent techniques based
on coinductive reasoning.

### [5] [AI-Assisted Fixes to Code Review Comments at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13499)
*Chandra Maddila,Negar Ghorbani,James Saindon,Parth Thakkar,Vijayaraghavan Murali,Rui Abreu,Jingyue Shen,Brian Zhou,Nachiappan Nagappan,Peter C. Rigby*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Meta开发了MetaMateCR，利用AI为代码审查提供自动修复建议，并通过安全试验确保不影响审查效率，最终在生产中显著提升了修复率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta每周有数万条代码审查评论，需要高效工具辅助开发者快速修复问题。

Method: 通过64k数据点微调Llama模型，并进行离线测试、安全试验和生产实验。

Result: 大型Llama模型离线准确率68%，优于GPT-4o 9个百分点；生产中修复率提升9.2个百分点。

Conclusion: MetaMateCR展示了AI辅助工具在规模化应用中的成功，同时强调了安全试验的重要性。

Abstract: Aim. There are 10s of thousands of code review comments each week at Meta. We
developed Metamate for Code Review (MetaMateCR) that provides AI-assisted fixes
for reviewer comments in production at scale.
  Method. We developed an internal benchmark of 64k <review comment, patch>
data points to fine-tune Llama models. Once our models achieve reasonable
offline results, we roll them into production. To ensure that our AI-assisted
fixes do not negatively impact the time it takes to do code reviews, we conduct
randomized controlled safety trials as well as full production experiments.
  Offline Results. As a baseline, we compare GPT-4o to our small and large
Llama models. In offline results, our LargeLSFT model creates an exact match
patch 68% of the time outperforming GPT-4o by 9 percentage points (pp). The
internal models also use more modern Hack functions when compared to the PHP
functions suggested by GPT-4o.
  Safety Trial. When we roll MetaMateCR into production in a safety trial that
compares no AI patches with AI patch suggestions, we see a large regression
with reviewers taking over 5% longer to conduct reviews. After investigation,
we modify the UX to only show authors the AI patches, and see no regressions in
the time for reviews.
  Production. When we roll LargeLSFT into production, we see an
ActionableToApplied rate of 19.7%, which is a 9.2pp improvement over GPT-4o.
Our results illustrate the importance of safety trials in ensuring that AI does
not inadvertently slow down engineers, and a successful review comment to AI
patch product running at scale.

### [6] [SAQR-QC: A Logic for Scalable but Approximate Quantitative Reasoning about Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13635)
*Nengkun Yu,Jens Palsberg,Thomas Reps*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: SAQR-QC是一种用于量子电路的可扩展近似定量推理逻辑，通过牺牲部分精度和局部推理步骤实现高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量子程序验证技术效率低下，无法处理多量子位电路，需要一种可扩展的推理方法。

Method: 提出SAQR-QC逻辑，通过故意损失精度、控制精度损失积累和局部推理步骤实现高效推理。

Result: 通过GHZ电路和量子相位估计案例验证了SAQR-QC的有效性。

Conclusion: SAQR-QC为量子电路提供了一种可扩展的近似推理方法，适用于复杂量子算法。

Abstract: Reasoning about quantum programs remains a fundamental challenge, regardless
of the programming model or computational paradigm. Despite extensive research,
existing verification techniques are insufficient--even for quantum circuits, a
deliberately restricted model that lacks classical control, but still underpins
many current quantum algorithms. Many existing formal methods require
exponential time and space to represent and manipulate (representations of)
assertions and judgments, making them impractical for quantum circuits with
many qubits. This paper presents a logic for reasoning in such settings, called
SAQR-QC. The logic supports Scalable but Approximate Quantitative Reasoning
about Quantum Circuits, whence the name. SAQR-QC has three characteristics: (i)
some (deliberate) loss of precision is built into it; (ii) it has a mechanism
to help the accumulated loss of precision during a sequence of reasoning steps
remain small; and (iii) most importantly, to make reasoning scalable, all
reasoning steps are local--i.e., they each involve just a small number of
qubits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAQR-QC via two case studies: the
verification of GHZ circuits involving non-Clifford gates, and the analysis of
quantum phase estimation--a core subroutine in Shor's factoring algorithm.
