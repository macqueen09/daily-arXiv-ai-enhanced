This system (named ADVENTURE) is\ndesigned to deliver personalized programming exercises that are tailored to\nindividual learners' skill levels. ADVENTURE utilizes an ontology, named\nCONTINUOUS, which encompasses common concepts across multiple programming\nlanguages. The system leverages this ontology not only to visualize programming\nconcepts but also to provide hints during practice programming exercises and\nrecommend subsequent programming concepts. The adaptive mechanism is driven by\nthe Elo Rating System, applied in an educational context to dynamically\nestimate the most appropriate exercise difficulty for each learner. An\nexperimental study compared two instructional modes, adaptive and random, based\non six features derived from 1,186 code submissions across all the experimental\ngroups. The results indicate significant differences in four of six analyzed\nfeatures between these two modes. Notably, the adaptive mode demonstrates a\nsignificant difference over the random mode in two features, the submission of\ncorrect answers and the number of pass concepts. Therefore, these results\nunderscore that this adaptive learning support system may support learners in\npracticing programming exercises.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u4f53\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edfADVENTURE\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7f16\u7a0b\u7ec3\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Elo\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u7f16\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u7ec3\u4e60\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u672c\u4f53CONTINUOUS\u548cElo\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7ec3\u4e60\u96be\u5ea6\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u63d0\u4ea4\u548c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u6570\u91cf\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "ADVENTURE\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u7f16\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7684\u7ec3\u4e60\u3002"}}

However,\nintegrating such tools into large, existing codebases remains a significant\nchallenge. While annotation inference can eliminate many errors automatically,\na subset of residual errors -- typically a mix of real bugs and false positives\n-- often persist and can only be resolved via code changes. Manually addressing\nthese errors is tedious and error-prone. Large language models (LLMs) offer a\npromising path toward automating these repairs, but naively-prompted LLMs often\ngenerate incorrect, contextually-inappropriate edits. Resolving a nullability\nerror demands a deep understanding of how a symbol is used across the codebase,\noften spanning methods, classes, and packages. We present NullRepair, a system\nthat integrates LLMs into a structured workflow for resolving the errors from a\nnullability checker. NullRepair's decision process follows a flowchart derived\nfrom manual analysis of 200 real-world errors. It leverages static analysis to\nidentify safe and unsafe usage regions of symbols, using error-free usage\nexamples to contextualize model prompts. Patches are generated through an\niterative interaction with the LLM that incorporates project-wide context and\ndecision logic. Our evaluation on 12 real-world Java projects shows that\nNullRepair resolves an average of 72% of the errors that remain after applying\na state-of-the-art annotation inference technique.
