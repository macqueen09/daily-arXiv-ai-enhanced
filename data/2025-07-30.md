### [1] [One Weird Trick to Untie Landin's Knot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21317)
*Paulette Koronkevich,William J. Bowman*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了Landin's Knot在编码递归中的作用，指出高阶引用本身不会导致非终止性，关键在于对函数环境的无限制量化。通过闭包转换语言展示了这一点，并提出限制量化可以安全地添加高阶引用。

Motivation: 研究Landin's Knot在编码递归中的作用，澄清高阶引用与非终止性的关系，探索如何在终止性语言中安全添加高阶引用。

Method: 使用闭包转换语言，将函数环境显式化，并通过非谓词量化隐藏环境类型。分析高阶引用如何利用这种量化编码递归。

Result: 发现高阶引用本身不导致非终止性，关键在于对函数环境的无限制量化。限制量化可以避免非终止性。

Conclusion: 限制对函数环境的量化可以安全地在终止性语言中添加高阶引用，无需复杂类型系统或限制函数存储。

Abstract: In this work, we explore Landin's Knot, which is understood as a pattern for
encoding general recursion, including non-termination, that is possible after
adding higher-order references to an otherwise terminating language. We observe
that this isn't always true -- higher-order references, by themselves, don't
lead to non-termination. The key insight is that Landin's Knot relies not
primarily on references storing functions, but on unrestricted quantification
over a function's environment. We show this through a closure converted
language, in which the function's environment is made explicit and hides the
type of the environment through impredicative quantification. Once references
are added, this impredicative quantification can be exploited to encode
recursion. We conjecture that by restricting the quantification over the
environment, higher-order references can be safely added to terminating
languages, without resorting to more complex type systems such as linearity,
and without restricting references from storing functions.

### [2] [Fixed-Point-Oriented Programming: A Concise and Elegant Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21439)
*Yong Qi Foo,Brian Sze-Kai Cheong,Michael D. Adams*

Main category: cs.PL

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编程范式缺乏对固定点计算的支持，导致实现低效且易错。

Method: FPOP通过结构化推理规则和用户导向优化，提供高级抽象，使开发者能编写声明式规范。

Result: FPOP显著简化算法实现，提升可维护性，例如图距离问题仅需两行代码。

Conclusion: FPOP填补了理论固定点公式与实际实现的差距，有望推动进一步研究和应用。

Abstract: Fixed-Point-Oriented Programming (FPOP) is an emerging paradigm designed to
streamline the implementation of problems involving self-referential
computations. These include graph algorithms, static analysis, parsing, and
distributed computing-domains that traditionally require complex and
tricky-to-implement work-queue algorithms. Existing programming paradigms lack
direct support for these inherently fixed-point computations, leading to
inefficient and error-prone implementations.
  This white paper explores the potential of the FPOP paradigm, which offers a
high-level abstraction that enables concise and expressive problem
formulations. By leveraging structured inference rules and user-directed
optimizations, FPOP allows developers to write declarative specifications while
the compiler ensures efficient execution. It not only reduces implementation
complexity for programmers but also enhances adaptability, making it easier for
programmers to explore alternative solutions and optimizations without
modifying the core logic of their program.
  We demonstrate how FPOP simplifies algorithm implementation, improves
maintainability, and enables rapid prototyping by allowing problems to be
clearly and concisely expressed. For example, the graph distance problem can be
expressed in only two executable lines of code with FPOP, while it takes an
order of magnitude more code in other paradigms. By bridging the gap between
theoretical fixed-point formulations and practical implementations, we aim to
foster further research and adoption of this paradigm.

### [3] [Composable Effect Handling for Programming LLM-integrated Scripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22048)
*Di Wang*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文提出使用可组合效应处理来分离工作流逻辑与效应操作（如LLM调用、I/O和并发），以提高模块化和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM集成脚本中模块化不足和性能优化受限的问题。

Method: 采用可组合效应处理技术，将效应操作抽象为接口并通过效应处理器实现。

Result: 在Tree-of-Thoughts案例中实现了10倍的加速，同时保持模块化。

Conclusion: 可组合效应处理是一种适用于LLM脚本编程的有效风格。

Abstract: Implementing LLM-integrated scripts introduces challenges in modularity and
performance, as scripts are often coupled to specific LLM implementations and
fail to exploit parallelization opportunities. This paper proposes using
composable effect handling to separate workflow logic from effectful
operations, such as LLM calls, I/O, and concurrency, enabling modularity
without sacrificing the opportunity for performance optimization. By treating
these operations as abstract interfaces and discharging them via effect
handlers, this paper shows that scripts can achieve significant speedups (e.g.,
10$\times$ in a Tree-of-Thoughts case study) without compromising modularity.
This paper aims to promote composable effect handling as a programming style
for LLM scripting.
