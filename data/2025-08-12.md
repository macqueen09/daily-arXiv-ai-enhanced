Conclusion: 通过公理化语义和原型工具验证了方法的有效性，为事件驱动程序的验证提供了新思路。

Abstract: Event-driven programming is a popular paradigm where the flow of execution is
controlled by two features: (1) shared memory and (2) sending and receiving of
messages between multiple handler threads (just called handler). Each handler
has a mailbox (modelled as a queue) for receiving messages, with the constraint
that the handler processes its messages sequentially. Executions of messages by
different handlers may be interleaved. A central problem in this setting is
checking whether a candidate execution is consistent with the semantics of
event-driven programs. In this paper, we propose an axiomatic semantics for
eventdriven programs based on the standard notion of traces (also known as
execution graphs). We prove the equivalence of axiomatic and operational
semantics. This allows us to rephrase the consistency problem axiomatically,
resulting in the event-driven consistency problem: checking whether a given
trace is consistent. We analyze the computational complexity of this problem
and show that it is NP-complete, even when the number of handler threads is
bounded. We then identify a tractable fragment: in the absence of nested
posting, where handlers do not post new messages while processing a message,
consistency checking can be performed in polynomial time. Finally, we implement
our approach in a prototype tool and report on experimental results on a wide
range of benchmarks.
