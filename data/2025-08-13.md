  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI驱动的AR技术多将儿童定位为消费者，而非创作者，Capybara旨在改变这一现状。

Method: Capybara结合文本生成3D的AI模型、自动绑定和身体追踪技术，以及基于视觉的AI模型，让儿童能够创建和编程3D虚拟角色。

Result: 用户研究表明，Capybara能有效帮助儿童创作个性化的AR体验，连接虚拟与现实世界。

Conclusion: Capybara展示了AI和AR技术如何赋能儿童成为内容创作者，而非被动消费者。

Abstract: Despite their potential to enhance children's learning experiences,
AI-enabled AR technologies are predominantly used in ways that position
children as consumers rather than creators. We introduce Capybara, an AR-based
and AI-powered visual programming environment that empowers children to create,
customize, and program 3D characters overlaid onto the physical world. Capybara
enables children to create virtual characters and accessories using text-to-3D
generative AI models, and to animate these characters through auto-rigging and
body tracking. In addition, our system employs vision-based AI models to
recognize physical objects, allowing children to program interactive behaviors
between virtual characters and their physical surroundings. We demonstrate the
expressiveness of Capybara through a set of novel AR experiences. We conducted
user studies with 20 children in the United States and Argentina. Our findings
suggest that Capybara can empower children to harness AI in authoring
personalized and engaging AR experiences that seamlessly bridge the virtual and
physical worlds.
