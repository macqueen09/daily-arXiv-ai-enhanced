We introduce Capybara, an AR-based\nand AI-powered visual programming environment that empowers children to create,\ncustomize, and program 3D characters overlaid onto the physical world. Capybara\nenables children to create virtual characters and accessories using text-to-3D\ngenerative AI models, and to animate these characters through auto-rigging and\nbody tracking. In addition, our system employs vision-based AI models to\nrecognize physical objects, allowing children to program interactive behaviors\nbetween virtual characters and their physical surroundings. We demonstrate the\nexpressiveness of Capybara through a set of novel AR experiences. We conducted\nuser studies with 20 children in the United States and Argentina. Our findings\nsuggest that Capybara can empower children to harness AI in authoring\npersonalized and engaging AR experiences that seamlessly bridge the virtual and\nphysical worlds.", "AI": {"tldr": "Capybara\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eAR\u548cAI\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u513f\u7ae5\u6210\u4e3a\u865a\u62df\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u800c\u975e\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684AR\u6280\u672f\u591a\u5c06\u513f\u7ae5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\uff0cCapybara\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u53d8\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u72b6\u3002", "method": "Capybara\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u751f\u62103D\u7684AI\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u7ed1\u5b9a\u548c\u8eab\u4f53\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684AI\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba9\u513f\u7ae5\u80fd\u591f\u521b\u5efa\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b3D\u865a\u62df\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "result": "\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cCapybara\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e2e\u52a9\u513f\u7ae5\u521b\u4f5c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684AR\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u865a\u62df\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "Capybara\u5c55\u793a\u4e86AI\u548cAR\u6280\u672f\u5982\u4f55\u8d4b\u80fd\u513f\u7ae5\u6210\u4e3a\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u88ab\u52a8\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u3002"}}
