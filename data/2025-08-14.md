Motivation: 探讨延续传递风格（CPS）在解析和打印结构化数据中的适用性，证明其在通用场景中仍具有价值。

Method: 提出三种基于CPS的解决方案，避免依赖类型和嵌套对的单子聚合，逐步增强表达能力。

Result: 展示了CPS方法在解析和打印结构化数据中的有效性，尤其是在处理列表和树等归纳结构时。

Conclusion: CPS方法在通用场景中仍具有显著优势，为解析和打印结构化数据提供了简洁而强大的工具。

Abstract: In the seminal paper Functional unparsing, Olivier Danvy used continuation
passing to reanalyse printf-like format strings as combinators. In the
intervening decades, the conversation shifted towards a concurrent line of work
-- applicative, monadic or arrow-based combinator libraries -- in an effort to
find combinators for invertible syntax descriptions that simultaneously
determine a parser as well as a printer, and with more expressive power, able
to handle inductive structures such as lists and trees. Along the way,
continuation passing got lost. This paper argues that Danvy's insight remains
as relevant to the general setting as it was to the restricted setting of his
original paper. Like him, we present three solutions that exploit
continuation-passing style as an alternative to both dependent types and
monoidal aggregation via nested pairs, in our case to parse and print
structured data with increasing expressive power.
