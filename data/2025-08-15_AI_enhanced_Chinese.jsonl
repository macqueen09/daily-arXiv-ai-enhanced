Optimizing compilers are key to realizing this potential, as they\nminimize expensive resource usage and limit error rates. A critical compilation\nstep is qubit mapping and routing (QMR), which finds mappings from circuit\nqubits to qubits on a target device and plans instruction execution while\nsatisfying the device's connectivity constraints. The challenge is that the\nlandscape of quantum architectures is incredibly diverse and fast-evolving.\nGiven this diversity, hundreds of papers have addressed the QMR problem for\ndifferent qubit hardware, connectivity constraints, and quantum error\ncorrection schemes.\n  We present an approach for automatically generating qubit mapping and routing\ncompilers for arbitrary quantum architectures. Though each QMR problem is\ndifferent, we identify a common core structure-device state machine-that we use\nto formulate an abstract QMR problem. Our formulation naturally leads to a\ndomain-specific language, Marol, for specifying QMR problems-for example, the\nwell-studied NISQ mapping and routing problem requires only 12 lines of Marol.\nWe demonstrate that QMR problems, defined in Marol, can be solved with a\npowerful parametric solver that can be instantiated for any Marol program. We\nevaluate our approach through case studies of important QMR problems from prior\nand recent work, covering noisy and fault-tolerant quantum architectures on all\nmajor hardware platforms. Our thorough evaluation shows that generated\ncompilers are competitive with handwritten, specialized compilers in terms of\nruntime and solution quality. We envision that our approach will simplify\ndevelopment of future quantum compilers as new quantum architectures continue\nto emerge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u8def\u7531\uff08QMR\uff09\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u91cf\u5b50\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00Marol\u7b80\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u624b\u5de5\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5316QMR\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bbe\u5907\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00Marol\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4e49QMR\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u548c\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e0e\u624b\u5de5\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u91cf\u5b50\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5316\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u65ad\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}
