Abstract: Quantum computers promise to solve important problems faster than classical
computers, potentially unlocking breakthroughs in materials science, chemistry,
and beyond. Optimizing compilers are key to realizing this potential, as they
minimize expensive resource usage and limit error rates. A critical compilation
step is qubit mapping and routing (QMR), which finds mappings from circuit
qubits to qubits on a target device and plans instruction execution while
satisfying the device's connectivity constraints. The challenge is that the
landscape of quantum architectures is incredibly diverse and fast-evolving.
Given this diversity, hundreds of papers have addressed the QMR problem for
different qubit hardware, connectivity constraints, and quantum error
correction schemes.
  We present an approach for automatically generating qubit mapping and routing
compilers for arbitrary quantum architectures. Though each QMR problem is
different, we identify a common core structure-device state machine-that we use
to formulate an abstract QMR problem. Our formulation naturally leads to a
domain-specific language, Marol, for specifying QMR problems-for example, the
well-studied NISQ mapping and routing problem requires only 12 lines of Marol.
We demonstrate that QMR problems, defined in Marol, can be solved with a
powerful parametric solver that can be instantiated for any Marol program. We
evaluate our approach through case studies of important QMR problems from prior
and recent work, covering noisy and fault-tolerant quantum architectures on all
major hardware platforms. Our thorough evaluation shows that generated
compilers are competitive with handwritten, specialized compilers in terms of
runtime and solution quality. We envision that our approach will simplify
development of future quantum compilers as new quantum architectures continue
to emerge.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本相似性的检索增强生成方法存在语义误导、冗余和同质化问题，且无法解决外部符号歧义。

Method: Saracoder采用分层特征优化模块，通过深度语义关系提取、重复项剪枝、基于图的结构相似性评估和结果重排序，并结合依赖分析的外部感知标识符消解模块。

Result: 在CrossCodeEval和RepoEval-Updated基准测试中，Saracoder显著优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: 多维度系统化优化检索结果为构建更准确和鲁棒的仓库级代码补全系统提供了新范式。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for repository-level code completion
commonly relies on superficial text similarity, leading to results plagued by
semantic misguidance, redundancy, and homogeneity, while also failing to
resolve external symbol ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce
Saracoder, a Hierarchical Feature-Optimized retrieval framework. Its core
Hierarchical Feature Optimization module systematically refines candidates by
distilling deep semantic relationships, pruning exact duplicates, assessing
structural similarity with a novel graph-based metric that weighs edits by
their topological importance, and reranking results to maximize both relevance
and diversity. Furthermore, an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator module
accurately resolves cross-file symbol ambiguity via dependency analysis.
Extensive experiments on the challenging CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated
benchmarks demonstrate that Saracoder significantly outperforms existing
baselines across multiple programming languages and models. Our work proves
that systematically refining retrieval results across multiple dimensions
provides a new paradigm for building more accurate and robust repository-level
code completion systems.
