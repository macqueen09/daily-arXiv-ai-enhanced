They usually provide first-class primitives to\nspecify how the program reacts to an external event (user input, network\nmessage), and how data flows through the program. Although these\ndomain-specific languages are now widely used to implement safety-critical\nGUIs, little work has been invested in their formalization and verification.\n  In this paper, we propose a denotational semantic model for a core reactive\nUIDL, Smalite, which we argue is expressive enough to encode constructs from\nmore realistic languages. This preliminary work may be used as a stepping stone\nto produce a formally verified compiler for UIDLs."}

Parameterized bisimilarity relates processes p and q with respect\nto an environment e if p and q behave bi-similarly while joining --\nrespectively the same -- transitions from e. The weakened variant relates\nprocesses p and q with respect to environment e if the join-interaction\nprocesses p & e and q & e of p and q with e are bisimilar. (Hereby join\ninteractions r & f facilitate a step with label a to r' & f' if and only if r\nand f permit a-steps to r' and f' , respectively.) Join-interaction\nparameterized (ji-parameterized) bisimilarity coincides with parameterized\nbisimilarity for deterministic environments, but that it is a coarser\nequivalence in general. We explain how Larsen's concept can be recovered from\nji-parameterized bisimilarity by 'determinizing' interactions. We show that by\nadaptation to simulatability (simulation preorder) the same concept arises:\nparameterized simulatability coincides with ji-parameterized simulatability.\nFor the discrimination preorder of (ji-)parameterized simulatability on\nenvironments we obtain the same result as Larsen did for parameterized\nbisimilarity. Also, we give a modal-logic characterization of\n(ji-)parameterized simulatability. Finally we gather open problems, and provide\nan outlook on our current related work."}
