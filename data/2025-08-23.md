### [1] [Homomorphism Calculus for User-Defined Aggregations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15109)
*Ziteng Wang,Ruijie Fang,Linus Zheng,Dixin Tang,Isil Dillig*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的同态形式计算法，用于验证和否定用户定义聚合函数是否满足同态形式性质，以支持高效的并行执行和增量计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Apache Spark和Flink等数据处理框架需要用户定义聚合函数满足同态形式性质才能实现高效执行，因此需要一种自动化方法来验证和构建合并运算符。

Method: 设计了一种新的同态形式计算法，该算法可以验证或否定UDAF是否为数据框同态形式，如果满足条件则能构建相应的合并运算符。实现了基于该计算法的算法。

Result: 在真实世界的UDAF上进行了评估，证明该方法显著地超过了两个领先的合成器。

Conclusion: 该同态形式计算法为验证和构建高效聚合函数提供了有效的解决方案，能够支持并行执行和增量计算。

Abstract: Data processing frameworks like Apache Spark and Flink provide built-in
support for user-defined aggregation functions (UDAFs), enabling the
integration of domain-specific logic. However, for these frameworks to support
\emph{efficient} UDAF execution, the function needs to satisfy a
\emph{homomorphism property}, which ensures that partial results from
independent computations can be merged correctly. Motivated by this problem,
this paper introduces a novel \emph{homomorphism calculus} that can both verify
and refute whether a UDAF is a dataframe homomorphism. If so, our calculus also
enables the construction of a corresponding merge operator which can be used
for incremental computation and parallel execution. We have implemented an
algorithm based on our proposed calculus and evaluate it on real-world UDAFs,
demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms two leading
synthesizers.

### [2] [Software Model Checking via Summary-Guided Search (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15137)
*Ruijie Fang,Zachary Kincaid,Thomas Reps*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: GPS是一种新的软件模型检测算法，结合了定向搜索和静态分析，能够高效发现程序安全证明和反例，在性能上优于现有最先进的模型检测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的软件模型检测方法在处理包含长输入依赖错误路径的程序时效率不高，需要一种既能证明安全性又能发现错误的高效算法。

Method: GPS采用基于组合静态分析的定向搜索策略，使用静态分析摘要来剪枝不可行路径并驱动测试生成，采用两层搜索策略和插装技术实现反驳完备性。

Result: GPS在SV-COMP和先前文献的基准测试中表现优异，在解决的基准数量和运行时间上都超过了最先进的软件模型检测器。

Conclusion: GPS算法通过结合静态分析和定向搜索，有效解决了长错误路径程序的模型检测问题，实现了高性能和反驳完备性。

Abstract: In this work, we describe a new software model-checking algorithm called GPS.
GPS treats the task of model checking a program as a directed search of the
program states, guided by a compositional, summary-based static analysis. The
summaries produced by static analysis are used both to prune away infeasible
paths and to drive test generation to reach new, unexplored program states. GPS
can find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs
that trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that
renders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long,
input-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense
that it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we
introduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve
refutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance. We benchmarked
GPS on a suite of benchmarks including both programs from the Software
Verification Competition (SV-COMP) and from prior literature, and found that
our implementation of GPS outperforms state-of-the-art software model checkers
(including the top performers in SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops category), both in
terms of the number of benchmarks solved and in terms of running time.

### [3] [Big-Stop Semantics: A Simple Way to Get the Benefits of Small-Step Semantics in a Big-Step Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15157)
*David M Kahn,Jan Hoffmann,Runming Li*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 大步步减步语义的扩展，通过归纳定义捕获分散计算，而不需要错误状态或复杂的推理规则


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大步步语义在语言设计中更受欢迎，因为它更直接地跳转到计算结果，但缺点是无法处理分散计算

Method: 提出大停止语义，在标准大步步推理规则基础上添加少量规则，通过归纳定义来定义与小步步过渡的自反传递闭包等价的评估判断

Result: 在类型化、非类型化和带效果的PCF语言以及while循环命令式语言中实现了这种方法，能够捕获分散计算

Conclusion: 大停止语义提供了一种简洁的方法来扩展大步步语义的能力，避免了其他方案中的复杂性和使用少见的推理原则

Abstract: As evident in the programming language literature, many practitioners favor
specifying dynamic program behavior using big-step over small-step semantics.
Unlike small-step semantics, which must dwell on every intermediate program
state, big-step semantics conveniently jump directly to the ever-important
result of the computation. Big-step semantics also typically involve fewer
inference rules than their small-step counterparts. However, in exchange for
ergonomics, big-step semantics give up power: Small-step semantics describes
program behaviors that are outside the grasp of big-step semantics, notably
divergence. This work presents a little-known extension of big-step semantics
with inductive definitions that captures diverging computations without
introducing error states. This big-stop semantics is illustrated for typed,
untyped, and effectful variants of PCF, as well as a while-loop-based
imperative language. Big-stop semantics extends the standard big-step inference
rules with a few additional rules to define an evaluation judgment that is
equivalent to the reflexive-transitive closure of small-step transitions. This
simple extension contrasts with other solutions in the literature which
sacrifice ergonomics by introducing many additional inference rules, global
state, and/or less-commonly-understood reasoning principles like coinduction.

### [4] [Probabilistic Inference for Datalog with Correlated Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15166)
*Jingbo Wang,Shashin Halalingaiah,Weiyi Chen,Chao Wang,Isil Dillig*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Praline是Datalog的新扩展，用于处理输入事实间统计相关性下的精确概率推理，通过约束优化和δ-精确算法实现可扩展的紧概率边界计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概率逻辑编程语言（如ProbLog）未考虑输入事实间的统计相关性，这限制了概率推理的精确性。

Method: 将推理任务建模为约束优化问题，提出δ-精确推理算法，结合约束求解、静态分析和迭代优化来提高可扩展性。

Result: 在包括侧信道分析在内的现实基准测试中，该方法不仅有效扩展，还能提供紧致的概率边界。

Conclusion: Praline通过处理输入相关性，实现了精确且可扩展的概率推理，为复杂应用提供了可靠的概率边界计算。

Abstract: Probabilistic extensions of logic programming languages, such as ProbLog,
integrate logical reasoning with probabilistic inference to evaluate
probabilities of output relations; however, prior work does not account for
potential statistical correlations among input facts. This paper introduces
Praline, a new extension to Datalog designed for precise probabilistic
inference in the presence of (partially known) input correlations. We formulate
the inference task as a constrained optimization problem, where the solution
yields sound and precise probability bounds for output facts. However, due to
the complexity of the resulting optimization problem, this approach alone often
does not scale to large programs. To address scalability, we propose a more
efficient $\delta$-exact inference algorithm that leverages constraint solving,
static analysis, and iterative refinement. Our empirical evaluation on
challenging real-world benchmarks, including side-channel analysis,
demonstrates that our method not only scales effectively but also delivers
tight probability bounds.

### [5] [Exploring the Theory and Practice of Concurrency in the Entity-Component-System Pattern](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15264)
*Patrick Redmond,Jonathan Castello,José Manuel Calderón Trilla,Lindsey Kuper*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文通过形式化模型Core ECS来探索实体-组件-系统(ECS)设计模式的本质，识别了可以实现调度无关决定性的类别／并指出现有ECS框架没有充分利用这些机会


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECS模式虽然在游戏开发中广泛使用，但在其他领域知名度不高，现有解释多假候具体框架细节或使用不完整的比喻，需要一个更严谨的理论基础

Method: 设计了一个形式模型Core ECS，抽象化具体实现细节来揭示ECS模式的本质特性，并识别具有调度无关决定性的类别

Result: 发现了一类Core ECS程序可以在任何调度情况下都表现出决定性，但对多个实际ECS框架的调研显示它们都没有充分利用这种可能性

Conclusion: 研究指出了新的ECS实现技术的发展空间，可以更好地利用决定性并发编程模型的优势

Abstract: The Entity-Component-System (ECS) software design pattern, long used in game
development, encourages a clean separation of identity (entities), data
properties (components), and computational behaviors (systems). Programs
written using the ECS pattern are naturally concurrent, and the pattern offers
modularity, flexibility, and performance benefits that have led to a
proliferation of ECS frameworks. Nevertheless, the ECS pattern is little-known
and not well understood outside of a few domains. Existing explanations of the
ECS pattern tend to be mired in the concrete details of particular ECS
frameworks, or they explain the pattern in terms of imperfect metaphors or in
terms of what it is not. We seek a rigorous understanding of the ECS pattern
via the design of a formal model, Core ECS, that abstracts away the details of
specific implementations to reveal the essence of software using the ECS
pattern. We identify a class of Core ECS programs that behave deterministically
regardless of scheduling, enabling use of the ECS pattern as a
deterministic-by-construction concurrent programming model. With Core ECS as a
point of comparison, we then survey several real-world ECS frameworks and find
that they all leave opportunities for deterministic concurrency unexploited.
Our findings point out a space for new ECS implementation techniques that
better leverage such opportunities.

*Francesco Dagnino,Paola Giannini,Violet Ka I Pun,Ulises Torrella*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 开发了一个资源感知的主动对象核心演算和类型系统，确保良好类型化的程序能够公平终止


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动对象系统是分布式计算模型，用于建模分布式系统和业务流程工作流。该领域本质上是并发和资源感知的，需要开发资源感知的形式化方法

Method: 结合了顺序程序中成熟的梯度语义和类型系统技术，以及为同步会话开发的公平终止技术

Result: 开发了一个核心演算和类型系统，确保良好类型化的程序能够公平终止（即总能最终终止）

Conclusion: 成功将顺序程序的梯度语义技术与同步会话的公平终止技术相结合，为资源感知的主动对象系统提供了形式化保证

Abstract: Active object systems are a model of distributed computation that has been
adopted for modelling distributed systems and business process workflows. This
field of modelling is, in essence, concurrent and resource-aware, motivating
the development of resource-aware formalisations on the active object model.
The contributions of this work are the development of a core calculus for
resource-aware active objects together with a type system ensuring that
well-typed programs are fairly terminating, i.e., they can always eventually
terminate. To achieve this, we combine techniques from graded semantics and
type systems, which are quite well understood for sequential programs, with
those for fair termination, which have been developed for synchronous~sessions.

Conclusion: 该研究为内存模型参数化的组合符号执行平台提供了坚实的形式化基础，增强了平台的灵活性、可扩展性和与其他工具的兼容性，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Multiple successful compositional symbolic execution (CSE) tools and
platforms exploit separation logic (SL) for compositional verification and/or
incorrectness separation logic (ISL) for compositional bug-finding, including
VeriFast, Viper, Gillian, CN, and Infer-Pulse. Previous work on the Gillian
platform, the only CSE platform that is parametric on the memory model, meaning
that it can be instantiated to different memory models, suggests that the
ability to use custom memory models allows for more flexibility in supporting
analysis of a wide range of programming languages, for implementing custom
automation, and for improving performance. However, the literature lacks a
satisfactory formal foundation for memory-model-parametric CSE platforms.
  In this paper, inspired by Gillian, we provide a new formal foundation for
memory-model-parametric CSE platforms. Our foundation advances the state of the
art in four ways. First, we mechanise our foundation (in the interactive
theorem prover Rocq). Second, we validate our foundation by instantiating it to
a broad range of memory models, including models for C and CHERI. Third,
whereas previous memory-model-parametric work has only covered SL analyses, we
cover both SL and ISL analyses. Fourth, our foundation is based on standard
definitions of SL and ISL (including definitions of function specification
validity, to ensure sound interoperation with other tools and platforms also
based on standard definitions).

### [8] [Active Learning for Neurosymbolic Program Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15750)
*Celeste Barnaby,Qiaochu Chen,Ramya Ramalingam,Osbert Bastani,Isil Dillig*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的主动学习技术SmartLabel，用于处理神经符号程序综合中的神经网络预测错误问题，通过约束遵循评估技术确保找到真正的目标程序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的符号主动学习技术在神经符号程序综合中效果不佳，因神经组件的预测错误导致返回非预期程序，需要新方法来处理这些挑战。

Method: 提出了约束遵循评估（CCE）新评估策略，在考虑用户反馈的同时处理神经网络预测错误。通过迭代提高CCE的精确性，直到所有剩余程序都保证观察等价。

Result: 在三个神经符号领域的实验中，SmartLabel能够为98%的测试找到真实目标程序，平均只需少于5轮用户交互。老方法最多只能在65%的测试上收敛到真实程序。

Conclusion: SmartLabel通过CCE技术有效解决了神经符号程序综合中的主动学习挑战，显著提高了找到正确程序的成功率和效率。

Abstract: The goal of active learning for program synthesis is to synthesize the
desired program by asking targeted questions that minimize user interaction.
While prior work has explored active learning in the purely symbolic setting,
such techniques are inadequate for the increasingly popular paradigm of
neurosymbolic program synthesis, where the synthesized program incorporates
neural components. When applied to the neurosymbolic setting, such techniques
can -- and, in practice, do -- return an unintended program due to
mispredictions of neural components. This paper proposes a new active learning
technique that can handle the unique challenges posed by neural network
mispredictions. Our approach is based upon a new evaluation strategy called
constrained conformal evaluation (CCE), which accounts for neural
mispredictions while taking into account user-provided feedback. Our proposed
method iteratively makes CCE more precise until all remaining programs are
guaranteed to be observationally equivalent. We have implemented this method in
a tool called SmartLabel and experimentally evaluated it on three neurosymbolic
domains. Our results demonstrate that SmartLabel identifies the ground truth
program for 98% of the benchmarks, requiring under 5 rounds of user interaction
on average. In contrast, prior techniques for active learning are only able to
converge to the ground truth program for at most 65% of the benchmarks.

### [9] [Mini-Batch Robustness Verification of Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15454)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出BaVerLy方法，通过分组验证ε-ball的局部鲁棒性，利用网络计算的相似性减少分析时间，平均提升验证速度2.3倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络局部鲁棒性验证器分析时间长或精度损失大，无法有效处理大规模输入集

Method: 动态构建和验证mini-batches，自适应识别成功的batch大小，对具有相似网络计算的ε-ball进行联合验证

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10的全连接和卷积网络上，平均加速2.3倍，最高达4.1倍，将24小时分析时间缩短至6小时

Conclusion: BaVerLy通过分组验证策略有效提升了局部鲁棒性验证的效率，为大规模安全关键应用提供了可行的验证方案

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical
applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To
understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have
been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers
introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less
effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to
local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to
leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls
to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete
verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of
$\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.
BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly
constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network
computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all
$\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected
as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy
leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball
as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on
fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show
that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and
up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6
hours.
