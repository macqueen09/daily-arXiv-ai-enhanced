### [1] [Homomorphism Calculus for User-Defined Aggregations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15109)
*Ziteng Wang,Ruijie Fang,Linus Zheng,Dixin Tang,Isil Dillig*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的同态演算法，用于验证和拒绝用户定义聚合函数是否满足同态性质，以支持高效并行执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Spark和Flink等框架支持UDAF，但要实现高效执行需要函数满足同态性质，这个验证过程很复杂。

Method: 设计了一种同态演算法，既能验证也能拒绝UDAF的同态性质，如果满足还能构造相应的合并操作符。

Result: 在真实世界UDAF上评估，证明该方法显著超过了两个领先的综合器。

Conclusion: 该同态演算法为UDAF的高效并行执行提供了可靠的验证和构造方法。

Abstract: Data processing frameworks like Apache Spark and Flink provide built-in
support for user-defined aggregation functions (UDAFs), enabling the
integration of domain-specific logic. However, for these frameworks to support
\emph{efficient} UDAF execution, the function needs to satisfy a
\emph{homomorphism property}, which ensures that partial results from
independent computations can be merged correctly. Motivated by this problem,
this paper introduces a novel \emph{homomorphism calculus} that can both verify
and refute whether a UDAF is a dataframe homomorphism. If so, our calculus also
enables the construction of a corresponding merge operator which can be used
for incremental computation and parallel execution. We have implemented an
algorithm based on our proposed calculus and evaluate it on real-world UDAFs,
demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms two leading
synthesizers.

### [2] [Software Model Checking via Summary-Guided Search (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15137)
*Ruijie Fang,Zachary Kincaid,Thomas Reps*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: GPS是一种新的软件模型检测算法，通过组合式静态分析和两层搜索策略，能够高效发现程序安全证明和反例，在SV-COMP基准测试中优于现有最先进工具


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件模型检测工具在处理具有长输入依赖错误路径的程序时效率不足，需要一种既能证明安全性又能发现错误的新方法

Method: GPS将模型检测视为程序状态的有向搜索，使用组合式静态分析生成摘要来剪枝不可行路径并驱动测试生成，采用两层搜索策略和插装技术实现反驳完备性

Result: 在SV-COMP和文献基准测试中，GPS在解决的问题数量和运行时间方面都优于最先进的软件模型检测器

Conclusion: GPS通过结合静态分析和定向搜索，实现了高效的程序验证和错误检测，特别擅长处理具有复杂错误路径的程序

Abstract: In this work, we describe a new software model-checking algorithm called GPS.
GPS treats the task of model checking a program as a directed search of the
program states, guided by a compositional, summary-based static analysis. The
summaries produced by static analysis are used both to prune away infeasible
paths and to drive test generation to reach new, unexplored program states. GPS
can find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs
that trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that
renders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long,
input-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense
that it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we
introduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve
refutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance. We benchmarked
GPS on a suite of benchmarks including both programs from the Software
Verification Competition (SV-COMP) and from prior literature, and found that
our implementation of GPS outperforms state-of-the-art software model checkers
(including the top performers in SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops category), both in
terms of the number of benchmarks solved and in terms of running time.

### [3] [Big-Stop Semantics: A Simple Way to Get the Benefits of Small-Step Semantics in a Big-Step Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15157)
*David M Kahn,Jan Hoffmann,Runming Li*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 提出了一种扩展的大步语义（big-stop semantics），通过归纳定义捕获发散计算，无需引入错误状态，保持了大步语义的简洁性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大步语义虽然简洁易用但无法描述程序发散行为，小步语义虽然强大但规则复杂。需要一种既能保持大步语义简洁性又能描述发散计算的解决方案

Method: 扩展标准大步推理规则，添加少量额外规则来定义等价于小步语义自反传递闭包的评估判断，应用于类型化、非类型化和带效应的PCF变体以及while循环命令式语言

Result: big-stop语义能够捕获发散计算，同时保持了大步语义的简洁性和易用性，避免了其他解决方案中引入过多额外规则、全局状态或不常见的推理原则

Conclusion: big-stop语义是大步语义的有效扩展，在保持简洁性的同时获得了小步语义的表达能力，为程序语义描述提供了更好的平衡方案

Abstract: As evident in the programming language literature, many practitioners favor
specifying dynamic program behavior using big-step over small-step semantics.
Unlike small-step semantics, which must dwell on every intermediate program
state, big-step semantics conveniently jump directly to the ever-important
result of the computation. Big-step semantics also typically involve fewer
inference rules than their small-step counterparts. However, in exchange for
ergonomics, big-step semantics give up power: Small-step semantics describes
program behaviors that are outside the grasp of big-step semantics, notably
divergence. This work presents a little-known extension of big-step semantics
with inductive definitions that captures diverging computations without
introducing error states. This big-stop semantics is illustrated for typed,
untyped, and effectful variants of PCF, as well as a while-loop-based
imperative language. Big-stop semantics extends the standard big-step inference
rules with a few additional rules to define an evaluation judgment that is
equivalent to the reflexive-transitive closure of small-step transitions. This
simple extension contrasts with other solutions in the literature which
sacrifice ergonomics by introducing many additional inference rules, global
state, and/or less-commonly-understood reasoning principles like coinduction.

### [4] [Probabilistic Inference for Datalog with Correlated Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15166)
*Jingbo Wang,Shashin Halalingaiah,Weiyi Chen,Chao Wang,Isil Dillig*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Praline是一个新的Datalog扩展，用于处理输入事实间存在统计相关性时的精确概率推理，通过约束优化和δ-精确推理算法提供可扩展的紧致概率边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概率逻辑编程语言（如ProbLog）在处理输出关系概率时未考虑输入事实间的统计相关性，这限制了推理的精确性。

Method: 将推理任务建模为约束优化问题，提出δ-精确推理算法，结合约束求解、静态分析和迭代优化来提高可扩展性。

Result: 在包括侧信道分析在内的真实基准测试中，该方法不仅具有良好可扩展性，还能提供紧致的概率边界。

Conclusion: Praline通过处理输入相关性并采用高效推理算法，实现了在大型程序中精确且可扩展的概率推理。

Abstract: Probabilistic extensions of logic programming languages, such as ProbLog,
integrate logical reasoning with probabilistic inference to evaluate
probabilities of output relations; however, prior work does not account for
potential statistical correlations among input facts. This paper introduces
Praline, a new extension to Datalog designed for precise probabilistic
inference in the presence of (partially known) input correlations. We formulate
the inference task as a constrained optimization problem, where the solution
yields sound and precise probability bounds for output facts. However, due to
the complexity of the resulting optimization problem, this approach alone often
does not scale to large programs. To address scalability, we propose a more
efficient $\delta$-exact inference algorithm that leverages constraint solving,
static analysis, and iterative refinement. Our empirical evaluation on
challenging real-world benchmarks, including side-channel analysis,
demonstrates that our method not only scales effectively but also delivers
tight probability bounds.

### [5] [Exploring the Theory and Practice of Concurrency in the Entity-Component-System Pattern](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15264)
*Patrick Redmond,Jonathan Castello,José Manuel Calderón Trilla,Lindsey Kuper*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Core ECS形式化模型，抽象ECS模式的本质，识别出可确定性执行的程序类，并发现现有ECS框架未能充分利用确定性并发机会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECS模式在游戏开发中广泛应用但外界了解有限，现有解释多局限于具体框架细节或不完美比喻，需要建立严谨的形式化理解。

Method: 设计Core ECS形式化模型，抽象具体实现细节，识别确定性行为程序类，并调研多个真实ECS框架进行比较分析。

Result: 发现所有调研的ECS框架都未能充分利用确定性并发机会，存在未开发的优化空间。

Conclusion: 研究指出了新的ECS实现技术发展空间，可更好地利用确定性并发机会，将ECS模式作为确定性构造的并发编程模型。

Abstract: The Entity-Component-System (ECS) software design pattern, long used in game
development, encourages a clean separation of identity (entities), data
properties (components), and computational behaviors (systems). Programs
written using the ECS pattern are naturally concurrent, and the pattern offers
modularity, flexibility, and performance benefits that have led to a
proliferation of ECS frameworks. Nevertheless, the ECS pattern is little-known
and not well understood outside of a few domains. Existing explanations of the
ECS pattern tend to be mired in the concrete details of particular ECS
frameworks, or they explain the pattern in terms of imperfect metaphors or in
terms of what it is not. We seek a rigorous understanding of the ECS pattern
via the design of a formal model, Core ECS, that abstracts away the details of
specific implementations to reveal the essence of software using the ECS
pattern. We identify a class of Core ECS programs that behave deterministically
regardless of scheduling, enabling use of the ECS pattern as a
deterministic-by-construction concurrent programming model. With Core ECS as a
point of comparison, we then survey several real-world ECS frameworks and find
that they all leave opportunities for deterministic concurrency unexploited.
Our findings point out a space for new ECS implementation techniques that
better leverage such opportunities.

### [6] [Fair Termination for Resource-Aware Active Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15333)
*Francesco Dagnino,Paola Giannini,Violet Ka I Pun,Ulises Torrella*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种资源感知的主动对象核心计算法，包含类型系统以确保程序的公平终止性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动对象系统是分布式计算和业务流程工作的重要模型，具有并发性和资源感知特性，需要开发资源感知的形式化方法。

Method: 结合了分级语义学和类型系统技术（通常用于序列程序）以及同步会话中开发的公平终止技术。

Result: 开发了一个核心计算法和类型系统，能够确保精确类型的程序具有公平终止性，即总能最终终止。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将序列程序的资源感知方法与并发系统的公平终止要求相结合，为分布式系统提供了可靠的形式化基础。

Abstract: Active object systems are a model of distributed computation that has been
adopted for modelling distributed systems and business process workflows. This
field of modelling is, in essence, concurrent and resource-aware, motivating
the development of resource-aware formalisations on the active object model.
The contributions of this work are the development of a core calculus for
resource-aware active objects together with a type system ensuring that
well-typed programs are fairly terminating, i.e., they can always eventually
terminate. To achieve this, we combine techniques from graded semantics and
type systems, which are quite well understood for sequential programs, with
those for fair termination, which have been developed for synchronous~sessions.

### [7] [Compositional Symbolic Execution for the Next 700 Memory Models (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15576)
*Andreas Lööw,Seung Hoon Park,Daniele Nantes-Sobrinho,Sacha-Élie Ayoun,Opale Sjöstedt,Philippa Gardner*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文为内存模型参数化组合符号执行平台提供了新的形式化基础，支持分离逻辑和错误分离逻辑分析，并在Rocq定理证明器中实现验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有组合符号执行工具虽然利用分离逻辑进行验证和错误发现，但缺乏对内存模型参数化平台的满意形式化基础，限制了灵活性和适用范围。

Method: 基于Gillian平台启发，在Rocq定理证明器中机械化形式化基础，支持多种内存模型（包括C和CHERI），涵盖分离逻辑和错误分离逻辑分析。

Result: 建立了首个同时支持SL和ISL分析的内存模型参数化形式化框架，验证了其在多种内存模型上的适用性。

Conclusion: 该形式化基础为组合符号执行平台提供了更灵活、标准化的理论基础，支持更广泛的编程语言分析和性能优化。

Abstract: Multiple successful compositional symbolic execution (CSE) tools and
platforms exploit separation logic (SL) for compositional verification and/or
incorrectness separation logic (ISL) for compositional bug-finding, including
VeriFast, Viper, Gillian, CN, and Infer-Pulse. Previous work on the Gillian
platform, the only CSE platform that is parametric on the memory model, meaning
that it can be instantiated to different memory models, suggests that the
ability to use custom memory models allows for more flexibility in supporting
analysis of a wide range of programming languages, for implementing custom
automation, and for improving performance. However, the literature lacks a
satisfactory formal foundation for memory-model-parametric CSE platforms.
  In this paper, inspired by Gillian, we provide a new formal foundation for
memory-model-parametric CSE platforms. Our foundation advances the state of the
art in four ways. First, we mechanise our foundation (in the interactive
theorem prover Rocq). Second, we validate our foundation by instantiating it to
a broad range of memory models, including models for C and CHERI. Third,
whereas previous memory-model-parametric work has only covered SL analyses, we
cover both SL and ISL analyses. Fourth, our foundation is based on standard
definitions of SL and ISL (including definitions of function specification
validity, to ensure sound interoperation with other tools and platforms also
based on standard definitions).

### [8] [Active Learning for Neurosymbolic Program Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15750)
*Celeste Barnaby,Qiaochu Chen,Ramya Ramalingam,Osbert Bastani,Isil Dillig*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的主动学习方法SmartLabel，专门处理神经符号程序合成中的神经网络误预测问题，通过约束一致性评估(CCE)技术显著提高了合成准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法在纯符号设置下有效，但在神经符号程序合成中由于神经网络组件的误预测会导致返回错误程序，需要新的技术来处理这一挑战

Method: 提出约束一致性评估(CCE)策略，考虑神经网络误预测并整合用户反馈，通过迭代优化CCE精度直到所有剩余程序保证观测等价

Result: 在三个神经符号领域实验中，SmartLabel在98%的基准测试中识别出真实程序，平均需要不到5轮用户交互，而先前技术最多只能达到65%的准确率

Conclusion: SmartLabel有效解决了神经符号程序合成中的主动学习挑战，显著提高了程序合成的准确性和用户交互效率

Abstract: The goal of active learning for program synthesis is to synthesize the
desired program by asking targeted questions that minimize user interaction.
While prior work has explored active learning in the purely symbolic setting,
such techniques are inadequate for the increasingly popular paradigm of
neurosymbolic program synthesis, where the synthesized program incorporates
neural components. When applied to the neurosymbolic setting, such techniques
can -- and, in practice, do -- return an unintended program due to
mispredictions of neural components. This paper proposes a new active learning
technique that can handle the unique challenges posed by neural network
mispredictions. Our approach is based upon a new evaluation strategy called
constrained conformal evaluation (CCE), which accounts for neural
mispredictions while taking into account user-provided feedback. Our proposed
method iteratively makes CCE more precise until all remaining programs are
guaranteed to be observationally equivalent. We have implemented this method in
a tool called SmartLabel and experimentally evaluated it on three neurosymbolic
domains. Our results demonstrate that SmartLabel identifies the ground truth
program for 98% of the benchmarks, requiring under 5 rounds of user interaction
on average. In contrast, prior techniques for active learning are only able to
converge to the ground truth program for at most 65% of the benchmarks.

### [9] [Mini-Batch Robustness Verification of Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15454)
*Saar Tzour-Shaday,Dana Drachsler Cohen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出BaVerLy方法，通过动态构建和验证mini-batches来提升局部鲁棒性验证效率，将验证速度平均提升2.3倍，最高可达4.1倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的局部鲁棒性验证器分析时间长或精度损失大，难以有效处理大量输入

Method: 利用ε-ball网络计算的相似性，动态构建mini-batches进行联合验证，采用自适应策略识别成功批次大小

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上，BaVerLy将验证速度平均提升2.3倍，最高达4.1倍，分析时间从24小时减少到6小时

Conclusion: BaVerLy通过分组验证策略有效提升了神经网络局部鲁棒性验证的效率和可扩展性

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical
applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To
understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have
been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers
introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less
effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to
local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to
leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls
to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete
verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of
$\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.
BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly
constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network
computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all
$\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected
as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy
leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball
as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on
fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show
that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and
up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6
hours.
