However, it is unclear how effective\nLLMs are in this task. In this paper, we perform a case study based on two\nmature Rocq projects: the hs-to-coq tool and Verdi. We evaluate the\neffectiveness of LLMs in generating proofs by both quantitative and qualitative\nanalysis. Our study finds that: (1) external dependencies and context in the\nsame source file can significantly help proof generation; (2) LLMs perform\ngreat on small proofs but can also generate large proofs; (3) LLMs perform\ndifferently on different verification projects; and (4) LLMs can generate\nconcise and smart proofs, apply classical techniques to new definitions, but\ncan also make odd mistakes."}

Existing methods primarily focus on LLM training and prompt\ndesign that utilize LLMs to generate executable programs directly from user\ntasks in natural language. However, due to the inconsistency of the LLMs and\nthe high complexity of the tasks, such best-effort approaches often lead to\ntremendous programming errors in the generated code, which significantly\nundermines the effectiveness especially when the light-weight LLMs are applied.\nThis paper introduces a natural-robotic language translation framework that (i)\nprovides correctness verification for generated control programs and (ii)\nenhances the performance of LLMs in program generation via feedback-based\nfine-tuning for the programs. To achieve this, a Robot Skill Language (RSL) is\nproposed to abstract away from the intricate details of the control programs,\nbridging the natural language tasks with the underlying robot skills. Then, the\nRSL compiler and debugger are constructed to verify RSL programs generated by\nthe LLM and provide error feedback to the LLM for refining the outputs until\nbeing verified by the compiler. This provides correctness guarantees for the\nLLM-generated programs before being offloaded to the robots for execution,\nsignificantly enhancing the effectiveness of LLM-powered robotic applications.\nExperiments demonstrate NRTrans outperforms the existing method under a range\nof LLMs and tasks, and achieves a high success rate for light-weight LLMs."}
