Abstract: This paper addresses the dichotomy between the formalization of structural
and the formalization of behavioral knowledge by means of semantically lifted
programs, which explore an intuitive connection between programs and knowledge
graphs. While knowledge graphs and ontologies are eminently useful to represent
formal knowledge about a system's individuals and universals, programming
languages are designed to describe the system's evolution. To address this
dichotomy, we introduce a semantic lifting of the program states of an
executing program into a knowledge graph, for an object-oriented programming
language. The resulting graph is exposed as a semantic reflection layer within
the programming language, allowing programmers to leverage knowledge of the
application domain in their programs. In this paper, we formalize semantic
lifting and semantic reflection for a small programming language, SMOL, explain
the operational aspects of the language, and consider type correctness and
virtualisation for runtime program queries through the semantic reflection
layer. We illustrate semantic lifting and semantic reflection through a case
study of geological modelling and discuss different applications of the
technique. The language implementation is open source and available online.

Abstract: We introduce Lattice Annotated Temporal (LAT) Logic, an extension of
Generalized Annotated Logic Programs (GAPs) that incorporates temporal
reasoning and supports open-world semantics through the use of a lower lattice
structure. This logic combines an efficient deduction process with temporal
logic programming to support non-Markovian relationships and open-world
reasoning capabilities. The open-world aspect, a by-product of the use of the
lower-lattice annotation structure, allows for efficient grounding through a
Skolemization process, even in domains with infinite or highly diverse
constants.
  We provide a suite of theoretical results that bound the computational
complexity of the grounding process, in addition to showing that many of the
results on GAPs (using an upper lattice) still hold with the lower lattice and
temporal extensions (though different proof techniques are required). Our
open-source implementation, PyReason, features modular design, machine-level
optimizations, and direct integration with reinforcement learning environments.
Empirical evaluations across multi-agent simulations and knowledge graph tasks
demonstrate up to three orders of magnitude speedup and up to five orders of
magnitude memory reduction while maintaining or improving task performance.
Additionally, we evaluate LAT Logic's value in reinforcement learning
environments as a non-Markovian simulator, achieving up to three orders of
magnitude faster simulation with improved agent performance, including a 26%
increase in win rate due to capturing richer temporal dependencies. These
results highlight LAT Logic's potential as a unified, extensible framework for
open-world temporal reasoning in dynamic and uncertain environments. Our
implementation is available at: pyreason.syracuse.edu.
