  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高阶函数语言中静态资源管理的挑战，区域系统限制资源于词法作用域，Rust的全局不变量使共享模式难以表达，可达性类型缺乏生命周期控制工具。

Method: 在可达性类型基础上提出两个新扩展：A<:采用新题两维存储模型支持区域内随意共享资源的粗粒度跟踪；{A}<:实现词法作用域生命周期控制和静态保证。

Result: 建立了第一个用于生命周期控制的可达性形式化系统，避免了流敏感推理的复杂性，保持了表达力和简洁性。两个计算法都在Rocq中形式化并证明了类型安全。

Conclusion: 该方法成功统一了不同资源管理方法的优点，既支持区域化共享和词法生命周期，也支持个体资源管理和非词法生命周期，保持了高阶函数语言的参数化特性。

Abstract: Static resource management in higher-order functional languages remains
elusive due to tensions between control, expressiveness, and flexibility.
Region-based systems [Grossman et al. 2002; Tofte et al. 2001] offer control
over lifetimes and expressive in-region sharing, but restrict resources to
lexical scopes. Rust, an instance of ownership types [Clarke et al. 2013],
offers non-lexical lifetimes and robust safety guarantees, yet its global
invariants make common sharing patterns hard to express. Reachability types
[Wei et al. 2024] enable reasoning about sharing and separation, but lack
practical tools for controlling resource lifetimes.
  In this work, we try to unify their strengths. Our solution enables grouping
resources as arenas for arbitrary sharing and static guarantees of lexically
scoped lifetimes. Crucially, arenas and lexical lifetimes are not the only
choice: users may also manage resources individually, with non-lexical
lifetimes. Regardless of mode, resources share the same type, preserving the
higher-order parametric nature of the language.
  Obtaining static safety guarantee in a higher-order language with flexible
sharing is nontrivial. To this end, we propose two new extensions atop
reachability types [Wei et al. 2024]. First, A<: features a novel
two-dimensional store model to enable coarse-grained reachability tracking for
arbitrarily shared resources within arenas. Building on this, {A}<: establishes
lexical lifetime control with static guarantees. As the first reachability
formalism presented for lifetime control, {A}<: avoids the complication of
flow-sensitive reasoning and retains expressive power and simplicity. Both
calculi are formalized and proven type safe in Rocq.
