Motivation: 现有验证提升系统在处理模板内核时存在效率瓶颈，需要开发更高效的方法来将遗留代码中的低级模板内核转换为现代DSL实现。

Method: 提出层次递归提升理论，使用不变子图表示模板内核，通过基于谓词的摘要编码计算语义；开发层次递归提升算法，通过收敛递归过程保证终止性。

Result: 在两个不同测试套件的多样化模板基准和四个实际应用上评估，相比最先进的STNG和Dexter系统分别实现31.62倍和5.8倍的加速，同时保持完全语义等价。

Conclusion: Stencil-Lifting显著提高了低级模板内核到DSL实现的转换效率，有效弥合了传统优化技术与现代DSL范式之间的差距。

Abstract: We introduce Stencil-Lifting, a novel system for automatically converting
stencil kernels written in low-level languages in legacy code into semantically
equivalent Domain-Specific Language (DSL) implementations. Targeting the
efficiency bottlenecks of existing verified lifting systems, Stencil-Lifting
achieves scalable stencil kernel abstraction through two key innovations.
First, we propose a hierarchical recursive lifting theory that represents
stencil kernels, structured as nested loops, using invariant subgraphs, which
are customized data dependency graphs that capture loop-carried computation and
structural invariants. Each vertex in the invariant subgraph is associated with
a predicate-based summary, encoding its computational semantics. By enforcing
self-consistency across these summaries, Stencil-Lifting ensures the derivation
of correct loop invariants and postconditions for nested loops, eliminating the
need for external verification. Second, we develop a hierarchical recursive
lifting algorithm that guarantees termination through a convergent recursive
process, avoiding the inefficiencies of search-based synthesis. The algorithm
efficiently derives the valid summaries of stencil kernels, and its
completeness is formally proven. We evaluate Stencil-Lifting on diverse stencil
benchmarks from two different suites and on four real-world applications.
Experimental results demonstrate that Stencil-Lifting achieves 31.62$\times$
and 5.8$\times$ speedups compared to the state-of-the-art verified lifting
systems STNG and Dexter, respectively, while maintaining full semantic
equivalence. Our work significantly enhances the translation efficiency of
low-level stencil kernels to DSL implementations, effectively bridging the gap
between legacy optimization techniques and modern DSL-based paradigms.
