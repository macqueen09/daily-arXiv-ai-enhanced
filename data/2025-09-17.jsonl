However, the rapid\ndevelopment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) - especially Large Language Model\n(LLM) - offers a promising new approach.\n  Despite this potential, data-driven approaches in this field have been\nhindered by a lack of suitable datasets. To address this gap, we constructed\nseveral datasets consisting of paired textual representations of SFC and LD\nprograms that conform to the IEC 61131-3 standard.\n  Based on these datasets, we explored the feasibility of automating the LD-SFC\nconversion using LLM. Our preliminary experiments show that a fine-tuned LLM\nmodel achieves up to 91% accuracy on certain dataset, with the lowest observed\naccuracy being 79%, suggesting that with proper training and representation,\nLLMs can effectively support LD-SFC conversion. These early results highlight\nthe viability and future potential of this approach."}

Recent work\nintroduced an LP compiler translating polynomial-time, polynomial-space\nalgorithms into polynomial-size LPs using intuitive high-level programming\nlanguages, offering a promising alternative to manually specifying each set of\nconstraints through Algebraic Modeling Languages (AMLs). However, the resulting\nLPs, while polynomial in size, are often extremely large, posing challenges for\nexisting LP solvers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating\nsubstantially smaller LPs from algorithms. Our goal is to establish\nminimum-size compact LP formulations for problems in P having natural\nformulations with exponential extension complexities. Our broader vision is to\nenable the systematic generation of Compact Integer Programming (CIP)\nformulations for problems with exponential-size IPs having polynomial-time\nseparation oracles. To this end, we introduce a hierarchical linear pipelining\ntechnique that decomposes nested program structures into synchronized regions\nwith well-defined execution transitions -- functions of compile-time\nparameters. This decomposition allows us to localize LP constraints and\nvariables within each region, significantly reducing LP size without the loss\nof generality, ensuring the resulting LP remains valid for all inputs of size\n$n$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two benchmark problems\n-- the makespan problem, which has exponential extension complexity, and the\nweighted minimum spanning tree problem -- both of which have exponential-size\nnatural LPs. Our results show up to a $25$-fold reduction in LP size and\nsubstantial improvements in solver performance across both commercial and\nnon-commercial LP solvers."}

When such software offers key\ncomponents of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB), e.g. an operating system kernel,\nit becomes desirable to provide mathematical correctness proofs.\n  However, current real-world imperative programming languages possess\n\"expressive\", i.e. overly permissive, semantics. Thus, producing correctness\nproofs of such programs becomes tedious and error-prone, requiring to take care\nof numerous \"administrative\" details. Ideally, a proof-oriented imperative\nlanguage should feature well-behaved semantics while allowing imperative\nidioms.\n  To obtain a high-degree of confidence in the correctness of such a language,\nits tools should be developed inside a proof-assistant such that program proofs\nare machine checked.\n  We present GallinaC, a shallow embedding of a Turing-complete imperative\nlanguage directly inside the functional programming language of the Rocq proof\nassistant, Gallina. In particular, it features a truly generic and unbounded\nwhile loop. Having a functional core means proofs about GallinaC programs may\nuse the same tactics as proofs about pure functional ones.\n  Work on GallinaC is still under progress, but we present first promising\nresults. A prototype implementation has shown the viability of GallinaC with\nthe correctness proof of a list reversal procedure for linked-lists of unknown\nsize. We currently focus on the forward simulation between the GallinaC\nintermediate representation (IR) and Cminor, the entry language of the CompCert\nback-end."}

The\nkey idea of our design is the use of first-class environments that map\nvariables to expressions in some new scope. By statically tracking scopes,\nusers of this library gain confidence that they have correctly maintained the\nsubtle invariants that stem from using de Bruijn indices. Behind the scenes,\nRebound uses environments to optimize the application of substitutions, while\nproviding explicit access to these data structures when desired. We demonstrate\nthat this library is expressive by using it to implement a wide range of\nlanguage features with sophisticated uses of binding and several different\noperations that use this abstract syntax. Our examples include pi-forall, a\ntutorial implementation of a type checker for a dependently-typed programming\nlanguage.
