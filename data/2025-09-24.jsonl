Existing compilers for such simulations typically focus\non low-level representations based on Pauli operators, limiting programmability\nand offering no formal guarantees of correctness across the compilation\npipeline. We introduce QBlue, a high-level, formally verified framework for\ncompiling Hamiltonian simulations. QBlue is based on the formalism of second\nquantization, which provides a natural and expressive way to describe quantum\nparticle systems using creation and annihilation operators. To ensure safety\nand correctness, QBlue includes a type system that tracks particle types and\nenforces Hermitian structure. The framework supports compilation to both\ndigital and analog quantum circuits and captures multiple layers of semantics,\nfrom static constraints to dynamic evolution. All components of QBlue,\nincluding its language design, type system, and compilation correctness, are\nfully mechanized in the Rocq proof framework, making it the first end-to-end\nverified compiler for second-quantized Hamiltonian simulation."}
