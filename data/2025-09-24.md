Motivation: 现有哈密顿模拟编译器通常基于低层次的泡利算符表示，限制了可编程性且缺乏编译管道的正确性保证。

Method: 基于二次量子化形式，使用产生和湮灭算符描述量子粒子系统；包含类型系统跟踪粒子类型并强制厄米结构；在Rocq证明框架中完全机械化实现。

Result: QBlue是首个端到端验证的二次量子化哈密顿模拟编译器，支持多种语义层，从静态约束到动态演化。

Conclusion: QBlue提供了一个安全、正确且表达性强的哈密顿模拟编译框架，填补了现有编译器的形式化验证空白。

Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is a central application of quantum computing, with
significant potential in modeling physical systems and solving complex
optimization problems. Existing compilers for such simulations typically focus
on low-level representations based on Pauli operators, limiting programmability
and offering no formal guarantees of correctness across the compilation
pipeline. We introduce QBlue, a high-level, formally verified framework for
compiling Hamiltonian simulations. QBlue is based on the formalism of second
quantization, which provides a natural and expressive way to describe quantum
particle systems using creation and annihilation operators. To ensure safety
and correctness, QBlue includes a type system that tracks particle types and
enforces Hermitian structure. The framework supports compilation to both
digital and analog quantum circuits and captures multiple layers of semantics,
from static constraints to dynamic evolution. All components of QBlue,
including its language design, type system, and compilation correctness, are
fully mechanized in the Rocq proof framework, making it the first end-to-end
verified compiler for second-quantized Hamiltonian simulation.
