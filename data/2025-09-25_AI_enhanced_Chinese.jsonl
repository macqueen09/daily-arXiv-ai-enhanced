This embedding is used as part of a testing framework for a compilers\ncourse to derive interpreters for all the intermediate languages. The embedding\nimplements features including safe, functional abstractions as well as unsafe\nassembly features, and the interactions between the two at various intermediate\nstages.\n  This paper aims to demonstrate language-oriented techniques and abstractions\nfor implementing (1) a large family of languages and (2) interoperability\nbetween low- and high-level languages. The primary strength of this approach is\nthe high degree of code reuse and interoperability compared to implementing\neach interpreter separately. The design emphasizes modularity and\ncompositionality of an open set of language features by local macro expansion\ninto a single host language, rather than implementing a language pre-defined by\na closed set of features. This enables reuse from both the host language\n(Racket) and between intermediate languages, and enables interoperability\nbetween high- and low-level features, simplifying development of the\nintermediate language semantics. It also facilitates extending or redefining\nindividual language features in intermediate languages, and exposing multiple\ninterfaces to the embedded languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4e2d\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u5bb6\u65cf\u4ece\u7c7bScheme\u8bed\u8a00\u5230x86-64\u5d4c\u5165\u5230Racket\u4e2d\u7684\u5b8f\u5d4c\u5165\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c55\u793a\u9762\u5411\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6280\u672f\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0(1)\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c(2)\u4f4e\u5c42\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u8a00\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4ee3\u7801\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u5b8f\u5c55\u5f00\u5230\u5355\u4e00\u5bbf\u4e3b\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u5c01\u95ed\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u5bbf\u4e3b\u8bed\u8a00(Racket)\u548c\u4e2d\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u5c42\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u4e2d\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e2d\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u5355\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6216\u91cd\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u5d4c\u5165\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}
