These include use of Haskell Generics for boilerplate reduction,\nstructured debugging traces, and ergonomic support for product types. We\ndescribe the design and implementation of Walrus through the lens of our\nexperience developing bidirectional compilers, and reflect on key design\ndecisions and recurring usability challenges encountered in practice."}

To be published in\n  the 7th Workshop on miniKanren and Relational Programming (miniKanren'25)", "summary": "We present {Kanren} (read: set-Kanren), an extension to miniKanren with\nconstraints for reasoning about sets and association lists. {Kanren} includes\nfirst-class set objects, a functionally complete family of set-theoretic\nconstraints (including membership, union, and disjointedness), and new\nconstraints for reasoning about association lists with shadowing and scoped\nlookup. These additions allow programmers to describe collections declaratively\nand lazily, without relying on structural encodings and eager search over\nrepresentation spaces. The result is improved expressiveness and operational\nbehavior in programs that manipulate abstract data -- particularly interpreters\n-- by supporting set equality based on contents, enabling finite failure. We\ndescribe the design and implementation of {Kanren} in a constraint-enabled\nminiKanren system and illustrate its use in representative examples."}
