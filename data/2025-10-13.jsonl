However, existing tensor compilers struggle to fuse\ncomplex reduction computations involving loop-carried dependencies, such as\nattention mechanisms.\n  The paper introduces Neptune, a tensor compiler for advanced operator fusion\nfor sequences of reduction operators. Neptune presents a new approach for\nadvanced operator fusion, which intentionally breaks some existing dependencies\nand compensates by constructing algebraic correction expressions that allow the\nkernel to produce the correct result.\n  On ten attention-based benchmarks, Neptune, starting from simple attention\ncode and a high-level scheduling template, outperforms existing compilers like\nTriton, TVM, and FlexAttention, including Triton-based implementations of\nFlashAttention. Across four different GPU architectures from NVIDIA and AMD,\nNeptune-generated kernels have average speedup of $1.35\\times$ over the next\nbest alternative, demonstrating its effectiveness for deep learning workloads."}

Conversely,\nimperative, flow-sensitive management enables fine-grained control but demands\nsophisticated typestate analyses and often burdens programmers with explicit\nstate tracking.\n  In this work, we present a novel approach that unifies the strengths of both\nparadigms by extending flow-insensitive capability mechanisms into\nflow-sensitive typestate tracking. Our system decouples capability lifetimes\nfrom lexical scopes, allowing functions to provide, revoke, and return\ncapabilities in a flow-sensitive manner, based on the existing mechanisms\nexplored for the safety and ergonomics of scoped capability programming.\n  We implement our approach as an extension to the Scala 3 compiler, leveraging\npath-dependent types and implicit resolution to enable concise, statically\nsafe, and expressive typestate programming. Our prototype generically supports\na wide range of stateful patterns, including file operations, advanced locking\nprotocols, DOM construction, and session types. This work demonstrates that\nexpressive and safe typestate management can be achieved with minimal\nextensions to existing capability-based languages, paving the way for more\nrobust and ergonomic stateful programming."}

Our system refines the existing\nreachability qualifier with polymorphic \\emph{use} and \\emph{kill} effects that\nrecord how references are read, written, transferred, and deallocated. The\neffect discipline tracks operations performed on each resource using\nqualifiers, enabling the type system to express ownership transfer, contextual\nfreshness, and destructive updates without regions or linearity. We formalize\nthe calculus, its typing and effect rules, and a compositional operational\nsemantics that validates use-after-free safety.

On the other\nhand, \\emph{floating} can be used to automatically get bug fixes and security\nfixes, but comes with the risk of breaking changes. Security practitioners\nadvocate \\emph{pinning} dependencies to prevent against software supply chain\nattacks, e.g., malicious package updates. However, since \\emph{pinning} is the\ntightest version constraint, \\emph{pinning} is the most likely to result in\noutdated dependencies. Nevertheless, how the likelihood of becoming outdated or\nvulnerable dependencies changes across version constraint types is unknown. The\ngoal of this study is to aid developers in making an informed dependency\nversion constraint choice by empirically evaluating the likelihood of\ndependencies becoming outdated or vulnerable across version constraint types at\nscale. In this study, we first identify the trends in dependency version\nconstraint usage and the patterns of version constraint type changes made by\ndevelopers in the npm, PyPI, and Cargo ecosystems. We then modeled the\ndependency state transitions using survival analysis and estimated how the\nlikelihood of becoming outdated or vulnerable changes when using \\emph{pinning}\nas opposed to the rest of the version constraint types. We observe that among\noutdated and vulnerable dependencies, the most commonly used version constraint\ntype is \\emph{floating-minor}, with \\emph{pinning} being the next most common.\nWe also find that \\emph{floating-major} is the least likely to result in\noutdated and \\emph{floating-minor} is the least likely to result in vulnerable\ndependencies."}

Current approaches, however,\nare hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails\nto repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language\nmodels (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for\ntasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this\nimpasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR),\ndesigned to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core\ninsight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a\ndeterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern,\ncreating a constrained and tractable problem space.

This combined\narchitecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for\nrule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.\nOur work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in\nautomated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the\nstate-of-the-art.
