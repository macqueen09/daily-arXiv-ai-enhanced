While numerous smart program synthesis tools exist,\nreusing and remixing previously developed methods is tedious and\ntime-consuming.

These compilers rely on existing CPU and GPU code\ngeneration backends to generate device-specific code. Recently, many tensor\naccelerators (neural processing units) have been proposed to further accelerate\nthese workloads. Compared to commodity hardware, however, most of the proposed\ntensor accelerators do not have compiler backends with code generation support.\nMoreover, the accelerator designs are subject to fast iteration cycles, making\nit difficult to manually develop compiler backends similar to commodity\nhardware platforms. Therefore, to increase adoption and enable faster software\ndevelopment cycles for novel tensor accelerator designs, we need to make the\ncompiler backend construction process more agile.\n  To address this gap, we introduce ACT, a compiler backend generator that\nautomatically generates compiler backends for tensor accelerators, given just\nthe instruction set architecture (ISA) descriptions. We first formally specify\nthe compiler backend generation problem that introduces a novel specification\nfor describing tensor accelerator ISAs. Next, we design ACT such that it\nsupports user-programmable memories and complex parameterized instructions that\nare prevalent in tensor accelerators. ACT uses a novel parameterized equality\nsaturation-based instruction selection phase and a constraint programming-based\nmemory allocation phase.

It is usually verified at the source level\n(e.g., by separation logics) and preserved to the target by verified compilers\n(e.g., CompCert), thereby achieving end-to-end verification of safety. However,\nmodern safe programming languages like Rust pose new problems in achieving\nend-to-end safety. Because not all functionalities can be implemented in the\nsafe language, mixing safe and unsafe modules is needed. Therefore, verified\ncompilation must preserve a modular notion of safety which can be composed at\nthe target level. Furthermore, certain classes of errors (e.g., memory errors)\nare automatically excluded by verifying compilation (e.g., borrow checking) for\nmodules written in safe languages. As a result, verified compilation needs to\ncooperate with verifying compilation to ensure end-to-end safety.\n  To address the above problems, we propose a modular and generic definition of\nsafety called open safety based on program semantics described as open labeled\ntransition systems (LTS). Open safety is composable at the boundary of modules\nand can be modularly preserved by verified compositional compilation. Those\nproperties enable separate verification of safety for heterogeneous modules and\ncomposition of the safety results at the target level. Open safety can be\ngeneralized to partial safety (i.e., only a certain class of errors can occur).\nBy this we formalized the correctness of verifying compilation as derivation of\ntotal safety from partial safety. We demonstrate how our framework can combine\nverified and verifying compilation by developing a verified compiler for an\nownership language (called Owlang) inspired by Rust. We evaluate our approach\non the compositional safety verification using a hash map implemented by Owlang\nand C."}

This paper introduces TyFlow, a novel system that internalizes\ntype reasoning within code generation to guide the model to learn the type\nsystem. The core of our approach is a novel type-guided program synthesis\nsystem that maintains an isomorphism between type derivation trees and\nsynthesis derivation trees, enabling a new code representation based on\nsynthesis decision sequences rather than traditional text-based token\nsequences. By offloading the complexity of type system learning to the\nrepresentation itself, models can redirect their computational resources toward\nhigher-level program semantics.

Modern memory allocators are designed to optimize allocation speed\nand memory fragmentation in multi-threaded environments, relying on complex\nmetadata and control logic to achieve high performance. However, the overhead\nintroduced by this complexity prompts a reevaluation of allocator design.\nNotably, such overhead can be avoided in single-threaded scenarios, which\ncontinue to be widely used across diverse application domains.\n  In this paper, we introduce Exgen-Malloc, a memory allocator purpose-built\nfor single-threaded applications. By specializing for single-threaded\nexecution, Exgen-Malloc eliminates unnecessary metadata, simplifies the control\nflow, thereby reducing overhead and improving allocation efficiency. Its core\ndesign features include a centralized heap, a single free-block list, and a\nbalanced strategy for memory commitment and relocation. Additionally,\nExgen-Malloc incorporates design principles in modern multi-threaded\nallocators, which do not exist in legacy single-threaded allocators such as\ndlmalloc. We evaluate Exgen-Malloc on two Intel Xeon platforms. Across both\nsystems, Exgen-Malloc achieves a speedup of 1.17x, 1.10x, and 1.93x over\ndlmalloc on SPEC CPU2017, redis-benchmark, and mimalloc-bench, respectively.

Recently, a\nnew class of tools, called speculative constant-time (SCT) tools, has also been\nused for detecting potential Spectre vulnerabilities. In many cases, these SCT\ntools have emerged as liftings of CT tools. However, these liftings are seldom\ndefined precisely and are almost never analyzed formally. The goal of this\npaper is to address this gap, by developing formal foundations for these\nliftings, and to demonstrate that these foundations can yield practical\nbenefits.\n  Concretely, we introduce a program transformation, coined Speculation-Passing\nStyle (SPS), for reducing SCT verification to CT verification. Essentially, the\ntransformation instruments the program with a new input that corresponds to\nattacker-controlled predictions and modifies the program to follow them. This\napproach is sound and complete, in the sense that a program is SCT if and only\nif its SPS transform is CT. Thus, we can leverage existing CT verification\ntools to prove SCT; we illustrate this by combining SPS with three standard\nmethodologies for CT verification, namely reducing it to non-interference,\nassertion safety and dynamic taint analysis. We realize these combinations with\nthree existing tools, EasyCrypt, BINSEC, and ctgrind, and we evaluate them on\nKocher's benchmarks for Spectre-v1.
