Recent efforts increasingly turn\nto code as a rich training source, given its inherent logical structure and\ndiverse reasoning paradigms such as divide-and-conquer, topological ordering,\nand enumeration. However, reasoning in code is often expressed implicitly and\nentangled with syntactic or implementation noise, making direct training on raw\ncode suboptimal.To address this, we introduce TracePile, a large-scale corpus\nof 2.6 million samples that transforms code execution into explicit,\nstep-by-step chain-of-thought-style rationales, which we call Chain of\nExecution (CoE). The corpus spans domains including mathematics, classical\nalgorithms and algorithmic competition, and is enriched with variable-tracing\nquestions and code rewritings to enhance logical granularity and code\ndiversity. We evaluate TracePile using three training setups:\ncontinue-pretraining, instruction tuning after pretraining, and two-stage\nfinetuning. Experiments across four base models (LLaMA 3, LLaMA 3.1, Qwen-2.5,\nand Qwen-2.5 Coder) and 20 benchmarks covering math, code, logic, and\nalgorithms demonstrate consistent improvements. Notably, TracePile boosts\nLLaMA3.1-8B by 7.1\\% on average across nine math datasets and delivers clear\ngains on LiveCodeBench, CRUX, and MMLU under two-stage fine-tuning."}

However, existing\nmodels often fail in practical workflows due to limited language coverage,\nunreliable execution, and lack of iterative correction mechanisms. Progress has\nbeen constrained by narrow datasets and benchmarks that emphasize single-round\ngeneration and single-language tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce\nthree complementary resources for advancing visualization coding agents.\nVisCode-Multi-679K is a large-scale, supervised dataset containing 679K\nvalidated and executable visualization samples with multi-turn correction\ndialogues across 12 programming languages. VisPlotBench is a benchmark for\nsystematic evaluation, featuring executable tasks, rendered outputs, and\nprotocols for both initial generation and multi-round self-debug. Finally, we\npresent VisCoder2, a family of multi-language visualization models trained on\nVisCode-Multi-679K. Experiments show that VisCoder2 significantly outperforms\nstrong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary\nmodels like GPT-4.1, with further gains from iterative self-debug, reaching\n82.4% overall execution pass rate at the 32B scale, particularly in symbolic or\ncompiler-dependent languages."}
