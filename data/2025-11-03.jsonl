This compiler pass repairs the connectivity\nof two-qubit gates whose operands are not adjacent by inserting SWAP gates that\nmove the state of qubits between directly connected qubits. Deciding when to\nintroduce SWAPs while minimizing their count is critical because the error in\nquantum programs increases exponentially with the circuit latency, measured in\nnumber of gates along the critical path of the circuit. Prior work for this\nproblem relied on heuristics and exact methods that partition the circuit into\ntwo or more layers, but failed to exploit valuable dependence information in\nany form.\n  This paper introduces a novel qubit mapping algorithm based on the weight of\ntransitive dependences. The introduced mapper models quantum circuits with\naffine abstractions thereby yielding the ability to compute transitive\ndependences. In turn, the newfound information is used to partition circuits by\ndependence distances and compute, efficiently, distinct weights for each layer.\nWe evaluate the efficiency of our mapper on IBM and Rigetti QPUs, using the\nlarge datasets from the QUEKO and QASMBench benchmark suites, and against four\nbaseline tools (QMAP, Sabre, Cirq and TKET), demonstrating notable improvements\nin circuit depth and swap count while delivering competitive scalability."}
