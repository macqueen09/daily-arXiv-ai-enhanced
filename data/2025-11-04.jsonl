Although this problem can be addressed by applying LLMs\nto formal rewrite systems, current LLMs are still far from adequate to generate\nsound rewrite chains. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes LLM-guided\nequality saturation, dubbed LGuess, by incorporating e-graphs as an\nintermediate layer between LLMs and rewrite systems. LGuess queries LLMs only\nfor high-level rewrite checkpoints and uses e-graphs to supply low-level\nrewrite chains between these checkpoints. The key technical challenge in this\nprocedure lies in effectively extracting a suitable checkpoint from a saturated\ne-graph, which LGuess addresses by learning a probabilistic model from the LLM.\nThe model predicts probable checkpoints while remaining simple enough for\neffective extraction. We implement a prototype of LGuess and evaluate it on the\nproblem of factorizing multivariable polynomials. The results demonstrate a\nsignificant advantage of LGuess compared to both straightforward equality\nsaturation and the approach that queries the LLM directly for the rewrite\nchain."}

Despite their advancement, empirical evidence reveals that\nthey still struggle with \\emph{deductive code reasoning}, the ability to reason\nabout the program execution process. While prior studies have recognized this\nlimitation, the underlying causes remain largely underexplored. In this paper,\nwe begin by presenting a comprehensive empirical study that reveals three key\nchallenges undermining deductive code reasoning: (1) an intrinsic gap between\ngeneration and reasoning abilities, (2) a consistent bias towards code sources,\nand (3) weak zero-shot generalization on complex benchmarks. In light of these\nchallenges, we propose \\texttt{ReMind}, a multi-agent framework composed of\n\\texttt{Mutator}, \\texttt{Executor}, and \\texttt{Inspector}. The\n\\texttt{Mutator} generates code variants to mitigate bias towards code sources,\nthe \\texttt{Executor} traces variable states step-by-step to expose\ninconsistency, and the \\texttt{Inspector} identifies problematic reasoning\nsteps and provides control-flow refinement to bridge the intrinsic reasoning\ngap. Through their coordinated collaboration, \\texttt{ReMind} systematically\nidentifies and refines reasoning flaws, achieving outstanding performance and\nenabling robust zero-shot generalization. Extensive experiments on two\nbenchmarks with five LLMs demonstrate the superior advantages of\n\\texttt{ReMind} compared to baseline approaches in deductive code reasoning."}

This paper investigates a novel approach\nto code optimization where Large Language Models (LLMs) guide the process\nthrough a closed-loop interaction with a compiler. We present ComPilot, an\nexperimental framework that leverages off-the-shelf LLMs, without any\ntask-specific fine-tuning, as interactive optimization agents. ComPilot\nestablishes a feedback loop where an LLM proposes transformations for a given\nloop nest to a compiler. The compiler attempts the transformations, reporting\nback legality status and measured speedup or slowdown. The LLM utilizes this\nconcrete feedback to iteratively refine its optimization strategy. Our\nextensive evaluation across the PolyBench benchmark suite demonstrates the\neffectiveness of this zero-shot approach. ComPilot achieves geometric mean\nspeedups of 2.66x (single run) and 3.54x (best-of-5 runs) over the original\ncode. Furthermore, ComPilot demonstrates competitive performance against the\nstate-of-the-art Pluto polyhedral optimizer, outperforming it in many cases.\nThis experimental study demonstrates that general-purpose LLMs can effectively\nguide the code optimization process when grounded by compiler feedback, opening\npromising research directions for agentic AI in code optimization."}

Among the\nchallenges for the developer is navigating a cost model in which conventional\noptimizations for linear algebra, such as subexpression reuse, can be\ninapplicable or unprofitable.\n  In this work, we present Cobble, a language for programming with quantum\ncomputational linear algebra.

However, existing systems often face a trade-off between\nefficiency and extensibility. Engines like Souffle achieve high efficiency\nthrough domain-specific designs, but lack general-purpose flexibility. Others,\nlike RecStep, offer modularity by layering Datalog on traditional databases,\nbut struggle to integrate Datalog-specific optimizations.\n  This paper bridges this gap by presenting FlowLog, a new Datalog engine that\nuses an explicit relational IR per-rule to cleanly separate recursive control\n(e.g., semi-naive execution) from each rule's logical plan. This boundary lets\nus retain fine-grained, Datalog-aware optimizations at the logical layer, but\nalso reuse off-the-shelf database primitives at execution. At the logical level\n(i.e. IR), we apply proven SQL optimizations, such as logic fusion and subplan\nreuse. To address high volatility in recursive workloads, we adopt a\nrobustness-first approach that pairs a structural optimizer (avoiding\nworst-case joins) with sideways information passing (early filtering). Built\natop Differential Dataflow--a mature framework for streaming analytics--FlowLog\nsupports both batch and incremental Datalog and adds novel recursion-aware\noptimizations called Boolean (or algebraic) specialization. Our evaluation\nshows that FlowLog outperforms state-of-the-art Datalog engines and modern\ndatabases across a broad range of recursive workloads, achieving superior\nscalability while preserving a simple and extensible architecture."}
