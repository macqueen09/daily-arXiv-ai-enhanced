We propose\nFuseFlow, a compiler that converts sparse machine learning models written in\nPyTorch to fused sparse dataflow graphs for reconfigurable dataflow\narchitectures (RDAs). FuseFlow is the first compiler to support general\ncross-expression fusion of sparse operations. In addition to fusion across\nkernels (expressions), FuseFlow also supports optimizations like\nparallelization, dataflow ordering, and sparsity blocking. It targets a\ncycle-accurate dataflow simulator for microarchitectural analysis of fusion\nstrategies. We use FuseFlow for design-space exploration across four real-world\nmachine learning applications with sparsity, showing that full fusion (entire\ncross-expression fusion across all computation in an end-to-end model) is not\nalways optimal for sparse models-fusion granularity depends on the model\nitself. FuseFlow also provides a heuristic to identify and prune suboptimal\nconfigurations. Using Fuseflow, we achieve performance improvements, including\na ~2.7x speedup over an unfused baseline for GPT-3 with BigBird block-sparse\nattention."}
