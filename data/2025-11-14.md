Abstract: We present Cyclotron, a framework and compiler for using recurrence equations to express streaming dataflow algorithms, which then get portably compiled to distributed topologies of interlinked processors. Our framework provides an input language of recurrences over logical tensors, which then gets lowered into an intermediate language of recurrences over logical iteration spaces, and finally into programs of send, receive, and computation operations specific to each individual processor. In Cyclotron's IR, programs are optimized such that external memory interactions are confined to the boundaries of the iteration space. Within inner iteration spaces, all data accesses become local: data accesses target values residing in local fast memory or on neighboring processing units, avoiding costly memory movement. We provide a scheduling language allowing users to define how data gets streamed and broadcasted between processors, enabling pipelined execution of computation kernels over distributed topologies of processing elements. We demonstrate the portability of our approach by compiling our IR to a reconfigurable simulator of systolic arrays and chiplet style distributed hardware, as well as to distributed-memory CPU clusters. In the simulated reconfigurable setting, we use our compiler for hardware design space exploration in which link costs and latencies can be specified. In the distributed CPU setting, we show how to use recurrences and our scheduling language to express various matrix multiplication routines (Cannon, SUMMA, PUMMA, weight stationary) and solvers (Triangular solve and Cholesky). For matrix multiplication and the triangular solve, we generate distributed implementations competitive with ScaLAPACK.

### [2] [Omnidirectional type inference for ML: principality any way](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10343)
*Alistair O'Brien,Didier Rémy,Gabriel Scherer*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了全向类型推断方法，通过动态信息流和挂起匹配约束来解决ML类型系统扩展中的非主型问题，比现有方法更灵活且表达能力更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML类型系统的扩展（如GADTs、高阶多态、静态重载）破坏了主型性，现有基于固定推断顺序的方法过于刚性，导致许多良好类型的程序被拒绝。

Method: 提出全向类型推断，允许类型信息按动态顺序流动，使用挂起匹配约束；引入增量实例化机制来处理let泛化问题。

Result: 该方法在OCaml的两种不同特性（记录标签和构造器的静态重载、半显式一等多态）上都实现了主型推断算法，比OCaml当前类型检查器更具表达力。

Conclusion: 全向性为在脆弱特性存在时恢复主型性提供了一个通用框架，能够处理ML扩展中的类型推断问题。

Abstract: The Damas-Hindley-Milner (ML) type system owes its success to principality, the property that every well-typed expression has a unique most general type. This makes inference predictable and efficient. Unfortunately, many extensions of ML (GADTs, higher-rank polymorphism, and static overloading) endanger princpality by introducing _fragile_ constructs that resist principal inference. Existing approaches recover principality through directional inference algorithms, which propagate _known_ type information in a fixed (or static) order (e.g. as in bidirectional typing) to disambiguate such constructs. However, the rigidity of a static inference order often causes otherwise well-typed programs to be rejected.
  We propose _omnidirectional_ type inference, where type information flows in a dynamic order. Typing constraints may be solved in any order, suspending when progress requires known type information and resuming once it becomes available, using _suspended match constraints_. This approach is straightforward for simply typed systems, but extending it to ML is challenging due to let-generalization. Existing ML inference algorithms type let-bindings (let x = e1 in e2) in a fixed order: type e1, generalize its type, and then type e2. To overcome this, we introduce _incremental instantiation_, allowing partially solved type schemes containing suspended constraints to be instantiated, with a mechanism to incrementally update instances as the scheme is refined.
  Omnidirectionality provides a general framework for restoring principality in the presence of fragile features. We demonstrate its versatility on two fundamentally different features of OCaml: static overloading of record labels and datatype constructors and semi-explicit first-class polymorphism. In both cases, we obtain a principal type inference algorithm that is more expressive than OCaml's current typechecker.

### [3] [Lazy Linearity for a Core Functional Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10361)
*Rodrigo Mesquita,Bernardo Toninho*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 提出Linear Core系统，在线性类型语言中区分句法线性和语义线性，适用于惰性求值语言如Haskell Core，保证线性资源使用并支持编译器优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性类型语言中，消费线性资源等同于其在程序中的句法出现。但在非严格求值下，句法出现不一定意味着实际使用资源，这一区别在Haskell优化编译器中不可避免。

Method: 引入Linear Core系统，静态接受线性的惰性语义，适用于惰性语言如GHC Core中间语言。证明系统正确性，保证线性资源使用，并验证优化转换在线性Core中保持线性性。

Result: 实现了Linear Core作为编译器插件，验证了系统在线性密集型库（包括linear-base）中的有效性。

Conclusion: Linear Core成功解决了惰性语言中句法线性与语义线性的不一致问题，为线性类型在优化编译器中的使用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Traditionally, in linearly typed languages, consuming a linear resource is synonymous with its syntactic occurrence in the program. However, under the lens of non-strict evaluation, linearity can be further understood semantically, where a syntactic occurrence of a resource does not necessarily entail using that resource when the program is executed. While this distinction has been largely unexplored, it turns out to be inescapable in Haskell's optimising compiler, which heavily rewrites the source program in ways that break syntactic linearity but preserve the program's semantics. We introduce Linear Core, a novel system which accepts the lazy semantics of linearity statically and is suitable for lazy languages such as the Core intermediate language of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. We prove that Linear Core is sound, guaranteeing linear resource usage, and that multiple optimising transformations preserve linearity in Linear Core while failing to do so in Core. We have implemented Linear Core as a compiler plugin to validate the system against linearity-heavy libraries, including linear-base.

### [4] [Modeling Layout Abstractions Using Integer Set Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10374)
*Somashekaracharya G Bhaskaracharya,Aravind Acharya,Bastian Hagedorn,Vinod Grover*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出使用整数集库(ISL)为CuTe布局和Triton线性布局创建统一的数学表示，通过整数集关系实现形式化分析和正确性验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习编译器依赖布局抽象来管理逻辑张量结构与物理内存安排之间的复杂映射。CuTe布局和Triton线性布局是广泛采用的行业标准，但这两个布局系统具有不同的数学基础，无法进行统一的形式化分析和跨系统推理。

Method: 使用整数集库(ISL)通过整数集关系为两种布局系统创建统一的数学表示。对CuTe布局，使用基于步长的计算建模从多维坐标到线性索引的变换；对Triton线性布局，建模二进制向量空间变换，其中算术运算遵循有限域F_2规则。

Result: 实验评估表明，该系统能够处理从基本恒等变换到具有复杂步长配置和swizzle模式的多维张量排列的完整布局复杂性谱系，验证了跨不同布局范式的数学建模方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功弥合了CuTe和Triton布局系统之间的差距，为统一形式化分析、正确性验证以及未来跨系统优化策略奠定了基础。

Abstract: Modern deep learning compilers rely on layout abstractions to manage the complex mapping between logical tensor structures and physical memory arrangements. CuTe layouts and Triton linear layouts are widely adopted industry standards. However, these layout systems operate independently with distinct mathematical underpinnings, preventing unified formal analysis and cross-system reasoning. We bridge this gap by introducing a novel approach that leverages the Integer Set Library (ISL) to create a unified mathematical representation for both layout systems through integer set relations, thereby enabling rigorous formal analysis, correctness verification, and the foundation for future cross-system optimization strategies. Our approach models CuTe layouts through integer set relations that encode the transformation from multi-dimensional coordinates to linear indices using stride-based calculations, including sophisticated swizzle operations that perform bit-level manipulations for enhanced memory access patterns. For Triton linear layouts, we construct integer set relations that model the binary vector space transformations where arithmetic operations follow finite field F_2 rules. We implement a complete suite of layout manipulation algorithms for composition, inversion, complement using built-in operations in ISL to ensure mathematical correctness and preserve layout semantics. Experimental evaluation shows that the system handles the full spectrum of layout complexity, from elementary identity transformations to sophisticated multi-dimensional tensor arrangements with complex stride configurations and swizzle patterns, validating the mathematical modeling approach across different layout paradigms.

### [5] [zkStruDul: Programming zkSNARKs with Structural Duality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10565)
*Rahul Krishnan,Ashley Samuelson,Emily Yao,Ethan Cecchetti*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: zkStruDul是一个统一输入转换和谓词定义的语言，通过单一抽象消除重复代码和安全隐患，构建在现有NIZK技术之上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NIZK工具将谓词定义和输入转换分开实现，导致逻辑重复且必须精确匹配以避免安全漏洞。

Method: 开发zkStruDul语言，将输入转换和谓词定义统一为单一抽象，编译器可从中投影出两个过程，消除重复代码。

Result: zkStruDul提供了高层抽象，支持递归证明等重要特性，并证明了源级语义与投影语义的行为一致性。

Conclusion: zkStruDul解决了NIZK应用中逻辑重复和安全隐患问题，为NIZK技术提供了更安全高效的开发框架。

Abstract: Non-Interactive Zero Knowledge (NIZK) proofs, such as zkSNARKS, let one prove knowledge of private data without revealing it or interacting with a verifier. While existing tooling focuses on specifying the predicate to be proven, real-world applications optimize predicate definitions to minimize proof generation overhead, but must correspondingly transform predicate inputs. Implementing these two steps separately duplicates logic that must precisely match to avoid catastrophic security flaws. We address this shortcoming with zkStruDul, a language that unifies input transformations and predicate definitions into a single combined abstraction from which a compiler can project both procedures, eliminating duplicate code and problematic mismatches. zkStruDul provides a high-level abstraction to layer on top of existing NIZK technology and supports important features like recursive proofs. We provide a source-level semantics and prove its behavior is identical to the projected semantics, allowing straightforward standard reasoning.
