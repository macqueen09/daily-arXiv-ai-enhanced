Abstract: We present Cyclotron, a framework and compiler for using recurrence equations to express streaming dataflow algorithms, which then get portably compiled to distributed topologies of interlinked processors. Our framework provides an input language of recurrences over logical tensors, which then gets lowered into an intermediate language of recurrences over logical iteration spaces, and finally into programs of send, receive, and computation operations specific to each individual processor. In Cyclotron's IR, programs are optimized such that external memory interactions are confined to the boundaries of the iteration space. Within inner iteration spaces, all data accesses become local: data accesses target values residing in local fast memory or on neighboring processing units, avoiding costly memory movement. We provide a scheduling language allowing users to define how data gets streamed and broadcasted between processors, enabling pipelined execution of computation kernels over distributed topologies of processing elements. We demonstrate the portability of our approach by compiling our IR to a reconfigurable simulator of systolic arrays and chiplet style distributed hardware, as well as to distributed-memory CPU clusters. In the simulated reconfigurable setting, we use our compiler for hardware design space exploration in which link costs and latencies can be specified. In the distributed CPU setting, we show how to use recurrences and our scheduling language to express various matrix multiplication routines (Cannon, SUMMA, PUMMA, weight stationary) and solvers (Triangular solve and Cholesky). For matrix multiplication and the triangular solve, we generate distributed implementations competitive with ScaLAPACK.

### [2] [Omnidirectional type inference for ML: principality any way](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10343)
*Alistair O'Brien,Didier Rémy,Gabriel Scherer*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为"全向类型推断"的新方法，通过动态信息流和悬挂匹配约束来解决ML类型系统扩展中的主类型性问题，比现有的双向类型推断更灵活且表达能力更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML类型系统的成功源于其主类型性，但许多扩展（如GADTs、高阶多态、静态重载）引入了脆弱构造，破坏了主类型性。现有的双向类型推断方法由于固定的推断顺序，经常拒绝本来类型正确的程序。

Method: 提出了全向类型推断，允许类型信息以动态顺序流动，使用悬挂匹配约束来暂停和恢复类型约束求解。引入了增量实例化机制，允许包含悬挂约束的部分求解类型方案被实例化。

Result: 该方法在OCaml的两个不同特性上验证了有效性：记录标签和数据构造器的静态重载，以及半显式一等多态。在这两种情况下都获得了比OCaml当前类型检查器表达能力更强的主类型推断算法。

Conclusion: 全向类型推断为在存在脆弱特性的情况下恢复主类型性提供了一个通用框架，比现有方法更灵活且表达能力更强。

Abstract: The Damas-Hindley-Milner (ML) type system owes its success to principality, the property that every well-typed expression has a unique most general type. This makes inference predictable and efficient. Unfortunately, many extensions of ML (GADTs, higher-rank polymorphism, and static overloading) endanger princpality by introducing _fragile_ constructs that resist principal inference. Existing approaches recover principality through directional inference algorithms, which propagate _known_ type information in a fixed (or static) order (e.g. as in bidirectional typing) to disambiguate such constructs. However, the rigidity of a static inference order often causes otherwise well-typed programs to be rejected.
  We propose _omnidirectional_ type inference, where type information flows in a dynamic order. Typing constraints may be solved in any order, suspending when progress requires known type information and resuming once it becomes available, using _suspended match constraints_. This approach is straightforward for simply typed systems, but extending it to ML is challenging due to let-generalization. Existing ML inference algorithms type let-bindings (let x = e1 in e2) in a fixed order: type e1, generalize its type, and then type e2. To overcome this, we introduce _incremental instantiation_, allowing partially solved type schemes containing suspended constraints to be instantiated, with a mechanism to incrementally update instances as the scheme is refined.
  Omnidirectionality provides a general framework for restoring principality in the presence of fragile features. We demonstrate its versatility on two fundamentally different features of OCaml: static overloading of record labels and datatype constructors and semi-explicit first-class polymorphism. In both cases, we obtain a principal type inference algorithm that is more expressive than OCaml's current typechecker.

### [3] [Lazy Linearity for a Core Functional Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10361)
*Rodrigo Mesquita,Bernardo Toninho*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 提出了Linear Core系统，在惰性求值语言中静态接受线性语义，解决了优化编译器破坏语法线性但保持语义的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性类型语言中，消费线性资源等同于语法出现，但在非严格求值下，语法出现不一定意味着执行时实际使用资源。Haskell优化编译器会重写程序破坏语法线性但保持语义，这促使需要新的线性系统

Method: 引入Linear Core系统，该系统接受惰性线性语义，适用于惰性语言如GHC的Core中间语言。证明系统是健全的，保证线性资源使用，且多个优化转换在Linear Core中保持线性

Result: 实现了Linear Core作为编译器插件，验证了系统在线性密集型库（包括linear-base）上的有效性

Conclusion: Linear Core成功解决了惰性语言中语法线性与语义线性之间的差异问题，为优化编译器提供了保持线性保证的框架

Abstract: Traditionally, in linearly typed languages, consuming a linear resource is synonymous with its syntactic occurrence in the program. However, under the lens of non-strict evaluation, linearity can be further understood semantically, where a syntactic occurrence of a resource does not necessarily entail using that resource when the program is executed. While this distinction has been largely unexplored, it turns out to be inescapable in Haskell's optimising compiler, which heavily rewrites the source program in ways that break syntactic linearity but preserve the program's semantics. We introduce Linear Core, a novel system which accepts the lazy semantics of linearity statically and is suitable for lazy languages such as the Core intermediate language of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. We prove that Linear Core is sound, guaranteeing linear resource usage, and that multiple optimising transformations preserve linearity in Linear Core while failing to do so in Core. We have implemented Linear Core as a compiler plugin to validate the system against linearity-heavy libraries, including linear-base.

### [4] [Modeling Layout Abstractions Using Integer Set Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10374)
*Somashekaracharya G Bhaskaracharya,Aravind Acharya,Bastian Hagedorn,Vinod Grover*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用整数集库(ISL)统一表示CuTe布局和Triton线性布局的新方法，通过整数集关系为两种布局系统建立统一的数学模型，支持形式化分析和正确性验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习编译器依赖布局抽象来管理逻辑张量结构与物理内存安排之间的复杂映射。CuTe布局和Triton线性布局是广泛采用的行业标准，但它们具有不同的数学基础，无法进行统一的形式化分析和跨系统推理。

Method: 使用整数集库(ISL)为两种布局系统创建统一的数学表示：对于CuTe布局，通过整数集关系建模从多维坐标到线性索引的变换；对于Triton线性布局，建模二进制向量空间变换。实现了一套完整的布局操作算法。

Result: 实验评估表明，该系统能够处理从基本恒等变换到具有复杂步长配置和swizzle模式的多维张量安排的完整布局复杂性谱系，验证了跨不同布局范式的数学建模方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地为CuTe和Triton布局系统建立了统一的数学基础，为未来的跨系统优化策略奠定了基础，并支持严格的形式化分析和正确性验证。

Abstract: Modern deep learning compilers rely on layout abstractions to manage the complex mapping between logical tensor structures and physical memory arrangements. CuTe layouts and Triton linear layouts are widely adopted industry standards. However, these layout systems operate independently with distinct mathematical underpinnings, preventing unified formal analysis and cross-system reasoning. We bridge this gap by introducing a novel approach that leverages the Integer Set Library (ISL) to create a unified mathematical representation for both layout systems through integer set relations, thereby enabling rigorous formal analysis, correctness verification, and the foundation for future cross-system optimization strategies. Our approach models CuTe layouts through integer set relations that encode the transformation from multi-dimensional coordinates to linear indices using stride-based calculations, including sophisticated swizzle operations that perform bit-level manipulations for enhanced memory access patterns. For Triton linear layouts, we construct integer set relations that model the binary vector space transformations where arithmetic operations follow finite field F_2 rules. We implement a complete suite of layout manipulation algorithms for composition, inversion, complement using built-in operations in ISL to ensure mathematical correctness and preserve layout semantics. Experimental evaluation shows that the system handles the full spectrum of layout complexity, from elementary identity transformations to sophisticated multi-dimensional tensor arrangements with complex stride configurations and swizzle patterns, validating the mathematical modeling approach across different layout paradigms.

### [5] [zkStruDul: Programming zkSNARKs with Structural Duality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10565)
*Rahul Krishnan,Ashley Samuelson,Emily Yao,Ethan Cecchetti*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: zkStruDul是一个统一输入转换和谓词定义的语言，通过单一抽象消除重复代码和安全不匹配问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NIZK工具将谓词定义和输入转换分开实现，导致逻辑重复且容易产生安全漏洞

Method: 开发zkStruDul语言，将输入转换和谓词定义统一为单一抽象，编译器可从中投影出两个过程

Result: 消除了重复代码和潜在的安全不匹配问题，支持递归证明等高级特性

Conclusion: zkStruDul提供了高层次抽象，可构建在现有NIZK技术之上，其源级语义与投影语义行为一致

Abstract: Non-Interactive Zero Knowledge (NIZK) proofs, such as zkSNARKS, let one prove knowledge of private data without revealing it or interacting with a verifier. While existing tooling focuses on specifying the predicate to be proven, real-world applications optimize predicate definitions to minimize proof generation overhead, but must correspondingly transform predicate inputs. Implementing these two steps separately duplicates logic that must precisely match to avoid catastrophic security flaws. We address this shortcoming with zkStruDul, a language that unifies input transformations and predicate definitions into a single combined abstraction from which a compiler can project both procedures, eliminating duplicate code and problematic mismatches. zkStruDul provides a high-level abstraction to layer on top of existing NIZK technology and supports important features like recursive proofs. We provide a source-level semantics and prove its behavior is identical to the projected semantics, allowing straightforward standard reasoning.
