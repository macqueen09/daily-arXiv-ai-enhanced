In recent work, Yao et al. scaled semantic typing to the verification of timed message-passing protocols, which are prevalent in, e.g., IoT and real-time systems applications. The appeal of semantic typing in this context is precisely because of its ability to support typed and untyped program components alike -- including physical objects -- which caters to the heterogeneity of these applications. Another demand inherent to these applications is timing: constraining the time or time window within which a message exchange must happen. Yao et al. equipped their logical relation not only with temporal predicates, but also with computable trajectories, to supply the evidence that an inhabitant can step from one time point to another one. While Yao et al. provide the formalization for such a verification tool, it lacks a mechanization. Mechanizing the system would not only provide a machine proof for it, but also facilitate scalability for future extensions and applications.\n  This paper tackles the challenge of mechanizing the resulting proof-relevant logical relation in a proof assistant. allowing trajectories to be interleaved, partitioned, and concatenated, while the intended equality on trajectories is the equality of their graphs when seen as processes indexed by time. Unfortunately, proof assistants based on intensional type theory only have modest support for such equations, forcing a prolific use of transports. This paper reports on the process of mechanizing Yao et al.'s results, comprising the logical relation, the algebra of computable trajectories with supporting lemmas, and the fundamental theorem of the logical relation, in the Rocq theorem prover.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728Rocq\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86Yao\u7b49\u4eba\u5173\u4e8e\u5b9a\u65f6\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u534f\u8bae\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u578b\u5316\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\u673a\u68b0\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee3\u6570\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u7b49\u5f0f\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9a\u65f6\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u578b\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u673a\u68b0\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u673a\u68b0\u5316\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u673a\u5668\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u672a\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728Rocq\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u4e2d\u673a\u68b0\u5316Yao\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\u672c\u8eab\u3001\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u4ea4\u9519\u3001\u5206\u533a\u3001\u8fde\u63a5\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u5f15\u7406\u548c\u57fa\u672c\u5b9a\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee3\u6570\u548c\u57fa\u672c\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5728\u5185\u6db5\u7c7b\u578b\u8bba\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7b49\u5f0f\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u68b0\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u578b\u5316\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u65f6\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u673a\u5668\u8bc1\u660e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

ADL compilers optimize datapaths and convert software-like control flow constructs into control paths. Such compilers are necessarily complex and often unpredictable: they must bridge the wide semantic gap between high-level semantics and cycle-level schedules, and they typically rely on advanced heuristics to optimize circuits. The resulting performance can be difficult to control, requiring guesswork to find and resolve performance problems in the generated hardware. We conjecture that ADL compilers will never be perfect: some performance unpredictability is endemic to the problem they solve.\n  In lieu of compiler perfection, we argue for compiler understanding tools that give ADL programmers insight into how the compiler's decisions affect performance. We introduce Petal, a cycle-level Petal for the Calyx intermediate language (IL). Petal instruments the Calyx code with probes and then analyzes the trace from a register-transfer-level simulation. It maps the events in the trace back to high-level control constructs in the Calyx code to track the clock cycles when each construct was active. Using case studies, we demonstrate that Petal's cycle-level profiles can identify performance problems in existing accelerator designs. We show that these insights can also guide developers toward optimizations that the compiler was unable to perform automatically, including a reduction by 46.9\\% of total cycles for one application.", "AI": {"tldr": "Petal\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9Calyx\u4e2d\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5468\u671f\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d2\u6869\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5206\u6790\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7406\u89e3\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u51b3\u7b56\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bed\u8a00(ADL)\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6c38\u8fdc\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u7406\u89e3\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u51b3\u7b56\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "Petal\u5728Calyx\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u63d2\u5165\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u4f20\u8f93\u7ea7\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c06\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6620\u5c04\u56deCalyx\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u6d3b\u8dc3\u65f6\u7684\u65f6\u949f\u5468\u671f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660ePetal\u7684\u5468\u671f\u7ea7\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u73b0\u6709\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u6267\u884c\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u603b\u5468\u671f\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8646.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "Petal\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u7406\u89e3\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3aADL\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6d1e\u5bdf\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u51b3\u7b56\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce DiverseClaire a pilot study, which simulates students including neurodiverse profiles using LLMs and diverse personas. By leveraging Bloom's Taxonomy and UDL, DiverseClaire compared UDL-transformed lecture slides with traditional formats. To evaluate DiverseClaire controlled experiments, we used the evaluation metric the average score.

MPC-based ML allows multiple parties to collaboratively run an ML workload without sharing their private data or model parameters using multi-party computing (MPC). Because MPC cannot natively run ML operations such as Softmax or GELU, existing frameworks use different approximations. Our study shows that, on a well-optimized framework, these approximations often become the dominating bottleneck. Popular approximations are often insufficiently accurate or unnecessarily slow, and these issues are hard to identify and fix in existing frameworks. To tackle this issue, we propose a compiler for MPC-based ML, CrypTorch. CrypTorch disentangles these approximations with the rest of the MPC runtime, allows easily adding new approximations through its programming interface, and automatically selects approximations to maximize both performance and accuracy. Built as an extension to PyTorch 2's compiler, we show that CrypTorch's auto-tuning alone provides 1.20--1.7$\\times$ immediate speedup without sacrificing accuracy, and 1.31--1.8$\\times$ speedup when some accuracy degradation is allowed, compared to our well-optimized baseline.

We further design a two-stage training framework, comprising Joint Expression Modeling and Dual-Space Optimization, to enhance the quality of both CRUX and Verilog code. Experiments across multiple Verilog generation benchmarks demonstrate that our model, CRUX-V, achieves state-of-the-art performance among general models, particularly under challenging design tasks.

Separation Logic is often extended to include inductively-defined predicates, interpreted as least fixpoints, forming Separation Logic with Inductive Definitions (SLID). Many theoretical and practical advances have been made in developing automated proof mechanisms for SLID, but these mechanisms are imperfect, and a deeper understanding of their failures is desired. As expressive as Separation Logic is, it is not surprising that it is incomplete, and in fact, it contains several sources of incompleteness that defy automated reasoning.\n  In this paper we study these sources of incompleteness and how they relate to failures of proof mechanisms. We place SLID within a larger logic, that we call Weak Separation Logic (WSL). We prove that unlike SLID, WSL is complete for a non-trivial fragment of quantified entailments with background theories and inductive definitions, via a reduction to first-order logic (FOL). Moreover, we show that the ubiquitous fold/unfold proof mechanism is sound and complete for theory-free, quantifier-free WSL entailments with inductive definitions. Through this, we understand proof failures as stemming from nonstandard models present in WSL, but not allowed in SLID. These rogue models are typically infinite, and we use the formalism of symbolic structures to represent and automatically find them.\n  We present a prototype tool that implements the FOL encoding of WSL and test it on an existing benchmark, which contains over 700 quantified entailment problems with inductive definitions. Our tool is able to find counter-models to many of the examples, and we provide a partial taxonomy of the rogue models, shedding some light on real-world proof failures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5206\u79bb\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u5f52\u7eb3\u5b9a\u4e49(SLID)\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f31\u5206\u79bb\u903b\u8f91(WSL)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86WSL\u5bf9\u5e26\u80cc\u666f\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5f52\u7eb3\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u8574\u542b\u662f\u5b8c\u5907\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u539f\u578b\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u53cd\u4f8b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u79bb\u903b\u8f91\u662f\u63a8\u7406\u5806\u64cd\u4f5c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u4e3b\u6d41\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f46SLID\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u81ea\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u8bc1\u660e\u673a\u5236\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u5c06SLID\u7f6e\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u5f31\u5206\u79bb\u903b\u8f91(WSL)\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u7ea6\u5230\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u8bc1\u660eWSL\u7684\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u793a\u548c\u53d1\u73b0\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660eWSL\u5bf9\u5e26\u80cc\u666f\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5f52\u7eb3\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u8574\u542b\u662f\u5b8c\u5907\u7684\uff0cfold/unfold\u673a\u5236\u5728\u65e0\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u65e0\u91cf\u8bcd\u7684WSL\u8574\u542b\u4e2d\u5b8c\u5907\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u539f\u578b\u5de5\u5177\u5728700\u591a\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u53cd\u4f8b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5931\u8d25\u6e90\u4e8eWSL\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4f46SLID\u4e0d\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u65e0\u9650\u7684\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5b9e\u9645\u8bc1\u660e\u5931\u8d25\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Evaluating on a diverse set of 23 C programs, ranging from 27 to 13,200 lines of code, Rustine can generate fully compilable Rust code for all and achieve 87% functional equivalence (passing 1,063,099 assertions out of 1,221,192 in test suites with average function and line coverage of 74.7% and 72.2%). Compared to six prior repository-level C to Rust translation techniques, the translations by Rustine are overall safer (fewer raw pointers, pointer arithmetic, and unsafe constructs), more idiomatic (fewer Rust linter violations), and more readable. When the translations cannot pass all tests to fulfill functional equivalence, human developers were able to complete the task in 4.5 hours, on average, using Rustine as debugging support.", "AI": {"tldr": "Rustine\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316C\u5230Rust\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u66f4\u5730\u9053\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u8bfb\u7684Rust\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709C\u5230Rust\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6280\u672f\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e73\u8861\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6c\u8bd1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4f46\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u4f46\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRustine\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u572823\u4e2aC\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6db5\u76d627\u523013,200\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "result": "Rustine\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u7f16\u8bd1\u7684Rust\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u8fbe\u523087%\u529f\u80fd\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc71,063,099/1,221,192\u4e2a\u65ad\u8a00\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u884c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4e3a74.7%\u548c72.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u516d\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0cRustine\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u66f4\u5730\u9053\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u8bfb\uff0c\u5f53\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u5e73\u5747\u53ea\u97004.5\u5c0f\u65f6\u5373\u53ef\u5b8c\u6210\u8c03\u8bd5\u3002"}}
