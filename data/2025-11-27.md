  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前e-class分析对循环程序分析效果不佳，特别是在SSA形式的程序中，需要更精确的分析方法。

Method: 使用抽象解释算法在等式饱和过程中精确分析循环，结合乐观分析和非破坏性重写，并在SSA程序上实现原型系统。

Result: 原型系统能够比clang和gcc更精确地分析简单示例程序。

Conclusion: 该方法为等式饱和提供了统一的乐观分析和非破坏性重写算法，在循环程序分析方面表现出更好的精确性。

Abstract: Equality saturation is a technique for program optimization based on non-destructive rewriting and a form of program analysis called e-class analysis. The current form of e-class analysis is pessimistic and therefore ineffective at analyzing cyclic programs, such as those in SSA form. We propose an abstract interpretation algorithm that can precisely analyze cycles during equality saturation. This results in a unified algorithm for optimistic analysis and non-destructive rewriting. We instantiate this approach on a prototype abstract interpreter for SSA programs using a new semantics of SSA. Our prototype can analyze simple example programs more precisely than clang and gcc.

### [2] [Towards Computational UIP in Cubical Agda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21209)
*Yee-Jian Tan,Andreas Nuyts,Dominique Devriese*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在Cubical Agda中实现h-Set立方类型理论的方法，分析了UIP的不同表述及其计算规则，并实现了无Glue的Cubical Agda变体。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cubical类型理论具有QIT和函数外延性等优势，但无限层级的等式层次在形式化中可能变得繁琐。虽然截断为h-Set后仍保留这些特性，但当前Cubical Agda中实现h-Set立方类型理论的方法存在不足。

Method: 分析UIP的不同表述及其计算规则，评估其在Cubical Agda中实现的适用性，并实现无Glue的Cubical Agda变体。

Result: 开发了与假设UIP兼容的无Glue Cubical Agda变体，为未来在Cubical Agda中实现UIP奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 本文为在Cubical Agda中实现h-Set立方类型理论提供了理论基础和初步实现，解决了当前实现方法的局限性。

Abstract: Some advantages of Cubical Type Theory, as implemented by Cubical Agda, over intensional Martin-Löf Type Theory include Quotient Inductive Types (QITs), which exist as instances of Higher Inductive Types, and functional extensionality, which is provable in Cubical Type Theory. However, HoTT features an infinite hierarchy of equalities that may become unwieldy in formalisations. Fortunately, QITs and functional extensionality are both preserved even if the equality levels of Cubical Type Theory are truncated to only homotopical Sets (h-Sets). In other words, removing the univalence axiom from Cubical Type Theory and instead postulating a conflicting axiom: the Uniqueness of Identity Proofs (UIP) postulate. Since univalence is proved in Cubical Type Theory from the so-called Glue Types, therefore, it is known that one can first remove the Glue Types (thus removing univalence) and then set-truncate all equalities (essentially assuming UIP), à la XTT. The result is a "h-Set Cubical Type Theory" that retains features such as functional extensionality and QITs.
  However, in Cubical Agda, there are currently only two unsatisfying ways to achieve h-Set Cubical Type Theory. The first is to give up on the canonicity of the theory and simply postulate the UIP axiom, while the second way is to use a standard result stating "type formers preserve h-levels" to manually prove UIP for every defined type. The latter is, however, laborious work best suited for an automatic implementation by the proof assistant. In this project, we analyse formulations of UIP and detail their computation rules for Cubical Agda, and evaluate their suitability for implementation. We also implement a variant of Cubical Agda without Glue, which is already compatible with postulated UIP, in anticipation of a future implementation of UIP in Cubical Agda.

Motivation: 解决不同编程语言验证工具之间的互操作性问题，使验证方法能够跨语言重用，促进技术转移。

Method: 设计SV-LIB格式，基于命令式编程语言概念，使用SMT-LIB表示表达式和类型，定义验证见证格式和验证任务规范。

Conclusion: SV-LIB为软件验证提供了统一的中间表示，便于集成到现有基础设施中，未来计划扩展形式语义和并发支持。

Abstract: In the past two decades, significant research and development effort went into the development of verification tools for individual languages, such asC, C++, and Java. Many of the used verification approaches are in fact language-agnostic and it would be beneficial for the technology transfer to allow for using the implementations also for other programming and modeling languages. To address the problem, we propose SV-LIB, an exchange format and intermediate language for software-verification tasks, including programs, specifications, and verification witnesses. SV-LIBis based on well-known concepts from imperative programming languages and uses SMT-LIB to represent expressions and sorts used in the program. This makes it easy to parse and to build into existing infrastructure, since many verification tools are based on SMT solvers already. Furthermore, SV-LIBdefines a witness format for both correct and incorrect SV-LIB programs, together with means for specifying witness-validation tasks. This makes it possible both to implement independent witness validators and to reuse some verifiers also as validators for witnesses. This paper presents version 1.0 of the SV-LIBformat, including its design goals, the syntax, and informal semantics. Formal semantics and further extensions to concurrency are planned for future versions.
