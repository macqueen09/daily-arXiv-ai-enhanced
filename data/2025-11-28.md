*Russel Arbore,Alvin Cheung,Max Willsey*

Motivation: 当前e-class分析是悲观的，对循环程序（如SSA形式程序）分析效果不佳，需要一种能够精确分析循环的乐观分析方法。

Method: 提出了一种抽象解释算法，将乐观分析和非破坏性重写统一起来，并在SSA程序的原型抽象解释器中实例化该方法，使用新的SSA语义。

Result: 原型系统能够比clang和gcc更精确地分析简单示例程序。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在等式饱和过程中对循环程序的精确分析，为程序优化提供了更有效的分析技术。

Abstract: Equality saturation is a technique for program optimization based on non-destructive rewriting and a form of program analysis called e-class analysis. The current form of e-class analysis is pessimistic and therefore ineffective at analyzing cyclic programs, such as those in SSA form. We propose an abstract interpretation algorithm that can precisely analyze cycles during equality saturation. This results in a unified algorithm for optimistic analysis and non-destructive rewriting. We instantiate this approach on a prototype abstract interpreter for SSA programs using a new semantics of SSA. Our prototype can analyze simple example programs more precisely than clang and gcc.

### [2] [Towards Computational UIP in Cubical Agda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21209)
*Yee-Jian Tan,Andreas Nuyts,Dominique Devriese*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文分析了在Cubical Agda中实现h-Set Cubical Type Theory的方法，探讨了UIP（唯一性身份证明）的表述形式及其计算规则，并实现了一个无Glue的Cubical Agda变体。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cubical Type Theory虽然具有QITs和函数外延性等优势，但存在无限层次等式的问题。通过截断到h-Set级别并假设UIP，可以在保留这些优势的同时简化形式化工作。

Method: 分析UIP的不同表述形式及其计算规则，评估其在Cubical Agda中的实现适用性，并实现一个无Glue类型的Cubical Agda变体。

Result: 提出了在Cubical Agda中实现h-Set Cubical Type Theory的可行方法，包括UIP的表述分析和无Glue变体的实现。

Conclusion: 通过移除Glue类型并假设UIP，可以构建一个保留函数外延性和QITs的h-Set Cubical Type Theory，为Cubical Agda的未来实现提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Some advantages of Cubical Type Theory, as implemented by Cubical Agda, over intensional Martin-Löf Type Theory include Quotient Inductive Types (QITs), which exist as instances of Higher Inductive Types, and functional extensionality, which is provable in Cubical Type Theory. However, HoTT features an infinite hierarchy of equalities that may become unwieldy in formalisations. Fortunately, QITs and functional extensionality are both preserved even if the equality levels of Cubical Type Theory are truncated to only homotopical Sets (h-Sets). In other words, removing the univalence axiom from Cubical Type Theory and instead postulating a conflicting axiom: the Uniqueness of Identity Proofs (UIP) postulate. Since univalence is proved in Cubical Type Theory from the so-called Glue Types, therefore, it is known that one can first remove the Glue Types (thus removing univalence) and then set-truncate all equalities (essentially assuming UIP), à la XTT. The result is a "h-Set Cubical Type Theory" that retains features such as functional extensionality and QITs.
  However, in Cubical Agda, there are currently only two unsatisfying ways to achieve h-Set Cubical Type Theory. The first is to give up on the canonicity of the theory and simply postulate the UIP axiom, while the second way is to use a standard result stating "type formers preserve h-levels" to manually prove UIP for every defined type. The latter is, however, laborious work best suited for an automatic implementation by the proof assistant. In this project, we analyse formulations of UIP and detail their computation rules for Cubical Agda, and evaluate their suitability for implementation. We also implement a variant of Cubical Agda without Glue, which is already compatible with postulated UIP, in anticipation of a future implementation of UIP in Cubical Agda.

### [3] [SV-LIB 1.0: A Standard Exchange Format for Software-Verification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21509)
*Dirk Beyer,Gidon Ernst,Martin Jonáš,Marian Lingsch-Rosenfeld*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: SV-LIB是一种用于软件验证任务的交换格式和中间语言，基于命令式编程语言概念，使用SMT-LIB表示表达式和类型，支持验证见证格式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有验证工具多为特定语言开发，但许多验证方法实际上是语言无关的。为促进技术转移，需要一种通用格式让验证工具实现能够跨语言复用。

Method: 提出SV-LIB格式，基于命令式编程语言概念，使用SMT-LIB表示表达式和类型。定义验证见证格式，支持正确和错误程序的见证，以及见证验证任务规范。

Result: 提出了SV-LIB 1.0版本，包括设计目标、语法和非形式化语义。该格式易于解析和集成到现有基础设施中。

Conclusion: SV-LIB为软件验证提供了语言无关的交换格式，支持验证工具间的互操作和见证验证。并发扩展和形式语义将在未来版本中实现。

Abstract: In the past two decades, significant research and development effort went into the development of verification tools for individual languages, such asC, C++, and Java. Many of the used verification approaches are in fact language-agnostic and it would be beneficial for the technology transfer to allow for using the implementations also for other programming and modeling languages. To address the problem, we propose SV-LIB, an exchange format and intermediate language for software-verification tasks, including programs, specifications, and verification witnesses. SV-LIBis based on well-known concepts from imperative programming languages and uses SMT-LIB to represent expressions and sorts used in the program. This makes it easy to parse and to build into existing infrastructure, since many verification tools are based on SMT solvers already. Furthermore, SV-LIBdefines a witness format for both correct and incorrect SV-LIB programs, together with means for specifying witness-validation tasks. This makes it possible both to implement independent witness validators and to reuse some verifiers also as validators for witnesses. This paper presents version 1.0 of the SV-LIBformat, including its design goals, the syntax, and informal semantics. Formal semantics and further extensions to concurrency are planned for future versions.
