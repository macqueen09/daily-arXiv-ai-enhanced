The current form of e-class analysis is pessimistic and therefore ineffective at analyzing cyclic programs, such as those in SSA form. We propose an abstract interpretation algorithm that can precisely analyze cycles during equality saturation. This results in a unified algorithm for optimistic analysis and non-destructive rewriting. We instantiate this approach on a prototype abstract interpreter for SSA programs using a new semantics of SSA. Our prototype can analyze simple example programs more precisely than clang and gcc."}

However, HoTT features an infinite hierarchy of equalities that may become unwieldy in formalisations. Fortunately, QITs and functional extensionality are both preserved even if the equality levels of Cubical Type Theory are truncated to only homotopical Sets (h-Sets). In other words, removing the univalence axiom from Cubical Type Theory and instead postulating a conflicting axiom: the Uniqueness of Identity Proofs (UIP) postulate. Since univalence is proved in Cubical Type Theory from the so-called Glue Types, therefore, it is known that one can first remove the Glue Types (thus removing univalence) and then set-truncate all equalities (essentially assuming UIP), à la XTT. The result is a \"h-Set Cubical Type Theory\" that retains features such as functional extensionality and QITs.\n  However, in Cubical Agda, there are currently only two unsatisfying ways to achieve h-Set Cubical Type Theory. The first is to give up on the canonicity of the theory and simply postulate the UIP axiom, while the second way is to use a standard result stating \"type formers preserve h-levels\" to manually prove UIP for every defined type. The latter is, however, laborious work best suited for an automatic implementation by the proof assistant. In this project, we analyse formulations of UIP and detail their computation rules for Cubical Agda, and evaluate their suitability for implementation. We also implement a variant of Cubical Agda without Glue, which is already compatible with postulated UIP, in anticipation of a future implementation of UIP in Cubical Agda."}

Many of the used verification approaches are in fact language-agnostic and it would be beneficial for the technology transfer to allow for using the implementations also for other programming and modeling languages. To address the problem, we propose SV-LIB, an exchange format and intermediate language for software-verification tasks, including programs, specifications, and verification witnesses. SV-LIBis based on well-known concepts from imperative programming languages and uses SMT-LIB to represent expressions and sorts used in the program. This makes it easy to parse and to build into existing infrastructure, since many verification tools are based on SMT solvers already. Furthermore, SV-LIBdefines a witness format for both correct and incorrect SV-LIB programs, together with means for specifying witness-validation tasks. This makes it possible both to implement independent witness validators and to reuse some verifiers also as validators for witnesses. This paper presents version 1.0 of the SV-LIBformat, including its design goals, the syntax, and informal semantics. Formal semantics and further extensions to concurrency are planned for future versions."}
