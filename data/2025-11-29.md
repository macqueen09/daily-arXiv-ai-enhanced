Motivation: 当前e-class分析对循环程序的分析过于悲观且无效，需要一种能够精确分析循环的算法。

Method: 采用抽象解释算法，结合新的SSA语义，在等式饱和过程中进行乐观分析和非破坏性重写。

Result: 原型系统能够比clang和gcc更精确地分析简单示例程序。

Conclusion: 提出的算法统一了乐观分析和非破坏性重写，在等式饱和中实现了对循环程序的精确分析。

Abstract: Equality saturation is a technique for program optimization based on non-destructive rewriting and a form of program analysis called e-class analysis. The current form of e-class analysis is pessimistic and therefore ineffective at analyzing cyclic programs, such as those in SSA form. We propose an abstract interpretation algorithm that can precisely analyze cycles during equality saturation. This results in a unified algorithm for optimistic analysis and non-destructive rewriting. We instantiate this approach on a prototype abstract interpreter for SSA programs using a new semantics of SSA. Our prototype can analyze simple example programs more precisely than clang and gcc.

### [2] [Towards Computational UIP in Cubical Agda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21209)
*Yee-Jian Tan,Andreas Nuyts,Dominique Devriese*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文分析如何在Cubical Agda中实现h-集合立方类型理论，通过移除胶合类型和截断等式层次来保留函数外延性和商归纳类型，同时避免高阶同伦类型的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 立方类型理论虽然提供了函数外延性和商归纳类型等优势，但其无限等式层次在形式化中可能变得繁琐。通过截断到h-集合层次可以简化理论，同时保留关键特性。

Method: 分析UIP的不同表述及其计算规则，实现无胶合类型的Cubical Agda变体，为将来在Cubical Agda中实现UIP做准备。

Result: 提出了两种实现h-集合立方类型理论的方法：直接假设UIP公理或手动为每个定义类型证明UIP，后者更适合自动化实现。

Conclusion: 无胶合类型的Cubical Agda变体已经与假设的UIP兼容，为将来在Cubical Agda中实现UIP奠定了基础。

Abstract: Some advantages of Cubical Type Theory, as implemented by Cubical Agda, over intensional Martin-Löf Type Theory include Quotient Inductive Types (QITs), which exist as instances of Higher Inductive Types, and functional extensionality, which is provable in Cubical Type Theory. However, HoTT features an infinite hierarchy of equalities that may become unwieldy in formalisations. Fortunately, QITs and functional extensionality are both preserved even if the equality levels of Cubical Type Theory are truncated to only homotopical Sets (h-Sets). In other words, removing the univalence axiom from Cubical Type Theory and instead postulating a conflicting axiom: the Uniqueness of Identity Proofs (UIP) postulate. Since univalence is proved in Cubical Type Theory from the so-called Glue Types, therefore, it is known that one can first remove the Glue Types (thus removing univalence) and then set-truncate all equalities (essentially assuming UIP), à la XTT. The result is a "h-Set Cubical Type Theory" that retains features such as functional extensionality and QITs.
  However, in Cubical Agda, there are currently only two unsatisfying ways to achieve h-Set Cubical Type Theory. The first is to give up on the canonicity of the theory and simply postulate the UIP axiom, while the second way is to use a standard result stating "type formers preserve h-levels" to manually prove UIP for every defined type. The latter is, however, laborious work best suited for an automatic implementation by the proof assistant. In this project, we analyse formulations of UIP and detail their computation rules for Cubical Agda, and evaluate their suitability for implementation. We also implement a variant of Cubical Agda without Glue, which is already compatible with postulated UIP, in anticipation of a future implementation of UIP in Cubical Agda.

### [3] [SV-LIB 1.0: A Standard Exchange Format for Software-Verification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21509)
*Dirk Beyer,Gidon Ernst,Martin Jonáš,Marian Lingsch-Rosenfeld*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: SV-LIB是一个用于软件验证任务的交换格式和中间语言，基于命令式编程语言概念，使用SMT-LIB表示表达式和类型，支持验证见证格式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有验证工具多为特定语言开发，但许多验证方法本质上是语言无关的。为促进技术转移，需要一种通用格式让验证工具实现跨语言复用。

Method: 设计SV-LIB格式，基于命令式编程语言概念，使用SMT-LIB表示表达式和类型，定义验证见证格式（包括正确和错误程序），支持见证验证任务规范。

Result: 提出了SV-LIB 1.0版本，包括设计目标、语法和非正式语义，使验证工具能够解析并集成到现有基础设施中。

Conclusion: SV-LIB为软件验证提供了语言无关的交换格式，促进了验证工具的可复用性。形式语义和并发扩展将在未来版本中实现。

Abstract: In the past two decades, significant research and development effort went into the development of verification tools for individual languages, such asC, C++, and Java. Many of the used verification approaches are in fact language-agnostic and it would be beneficial for the technology transfer to allow for using the implementations also for other programming and modeling languages. To address the problem, we propose SV-LIB, an exchange format and intermediate language for software-verification tasks, including programs, specifications, and verification witnesses. SV-LIBis based on well-known concepts from imperative programming languages and uses SMT-LIB to represent expressions and sorts used in the program. This makes it easy to parse and to build into existing infrastructure, since many verification tools are based on SMT solvers already. Furthermore, SV-LIBdefines a witness format for both correct and incorrect SV-LIB programs, together with means for specifying witness-validation tasks. This makes it possible both to implement independent witness validators and to reuse some verifiers also as validators for witnesses. This paper presents version 1.0 of the SV-LIBformat, including its design goals, the syntax, and informal semantics. Formal semantics and further extensions to concurrency are planned for future versions.
