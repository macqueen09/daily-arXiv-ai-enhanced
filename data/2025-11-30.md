  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前e类分析对循环程序的分析过于悲观且无效，特别是在SSA形式的程序中。

Method: 基于抽象解释的算法，结合乐观分析和非破坏性重写，在SSA程序上实现原型抽象解释器。

Result: 原型系统能够比clang和gcc更精确地分析简单示例程序。

Conclusion: 该方法成功统一了乐观分析和非破坏性重写，为等式饱和优化提供了更精确的循环分析能力。

Abstract: Equality saturation is a technique for program optimization based on non-destructive rewriting and a form of program analysis called e-class analysis. The current form of e-class analysis is pessimistic and therefore ineffective at analyzing cyclic programs, such as those in SSA form. We propose an abstract interpretation algorithm that can precisely analyze cycles during equality saturation. This results in a unified algorithm for optimistic analysis and non-destructive rewriting. We instantiate this approach on a prototype abstract interpreter for SSA programs using a new semantics of SSA. Our prototype can analyze simple example programs more precisely than clang and gcc.

### [2] [Towards Computational UIP in Cubical Agda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21209)
*Yee-Jian Tan,Andreas Nuyts,Dominique Devriese*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了在Cubical Agda中实现h-集合立方类型理论的方法，通过移除Glue类型和截断等式层次来保留函数外延性和商归纳类型，同时避免高阶同伦类型的复杂性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 立方类型理论虽然提供了函数外延性和商归纳类型等优势，但高阶等式层次可能使形式化变得复杂。作者希望找到一种方法，在保持这些优势的同时简化理论结构。

Method: 分析UIP的不同表述及其计算规则，移除Glue类型以消除单值性，然后截断所有等式层次到h-集合级别，实现与UIP兼容的立方类型理论变体。

Result: 提出了两种实现h-集合立方类型理论的方法：直接假设UIP公理或手动为每个定义类型证明UIP，并实现了一个没有Glue的Cubical Agda变体。

Conclusion: 在Cubical Agda中实现h-集合立方类型理论是可行的，但需要仔细设计UIP的计算规则，当前的方法要么牺牲规范性，要么需要大量手动工作，期待未来的自动化实现。

Abstract: Some advantages of Cubical Type Theory, as implemented by Cubical Agda, over intensional Martin-Löf Type Theory include Quotient Inductive Types (QITs), which exist as instances of Higher Inductive Types, and functional extensionality, which is provable in Cubical Type Theory. However, HoTT features an infinite hierarchy of equalities that may become unwieldy in formalisations. Fortunately, QITs and functional extensionality are both preserved even if the equality levels of Cubical Type Theory are truncated to only homotopical Sets (h-Sets). In other words, removing the univalence axiom from Cubical Type Theory and instead postulating a conflicting axiom: the Uniqueness of Identity Proofs (UIP) postulate. Since univalence is proved in Cubical Type Theory from the so-called Glue Types, therefore, it is known that one can first remove the Glue Types (thus removing univalence) and then set-truncate all equalities (essentially assuming UIP), à la XTT. The result is a "h-Set Cubical Type Theory" that retains features such as functional extensionality and QITs.
  However, in Cubical Agda, there are currently only two unsatisfying ways to achieve h-Set Cubical Type Theory. The first is to give up on the canonicity of the theory and simply postulate the UIP axiom, while the second way is to use a standard result stating "type formers preserve h-levels" to manually prove UIP for every defined type. The latter is, however, laborious work best suited for an automatic implementation by the proof assistant. In this project, we analyse formulations of UIP and detail their computation rules for Cubical Agda, and evaluate their suitability for implementation. We also implement a variant of Cubical Agda without Glue, which is already compatible with postulated UIP, in anticipation of a future implementation of UIP in Cubical Agda.

Abstract: In the past two decades, significant research and development effort went into the development of verification tools for individual languages, such asC, C++, and Java. Many of the used verification approaches are in fact language-agnostic and it would be beneficial for the technology transfer to allow for using the implementations also for other programming and modeling languages. To address the problem, we propose SV-LIB, an exchange format and intermediate language for software-verification tasks, including programs, specifications, and verification witnesses. SV-LIBis based on well-known concepts from imperative programming languages and uses SMT-LIB to represent expressions and sorts used in the program. This makes it easy to parse and to build into existing infrastructure, since many verification tools are based on SMT solvers already. Furthermore, SV-LIBdefines a witness format for both correct and incorrect SV-LIB programs, together with means for specifying witness-validation tasks. This makes it possible both to implement independent witness validators and to reuse some verifiers also as validators for witnesses. This paper presents version 1.0 of the SV-LIBformat, including its design goals, the syntax, and informal semantics. Formal semantics and further extensions to concurrency are planned for future versions.
