With gradual verification, programs can be partially specified first, and then the full specification of a program can be achieved in incremental steps. The first and only practicable gradual verifier based on symbolic execution, Gradual C0, supports recursive heap data structures. Despite recent efforts to improve the expressivity of Gradual C0's specification language, Gradual C0's specification language is still limited in its capabilities for complex expressions. This work explores an extension to Gradual C0's design with a common construct supported by many static verification tools, pure functions, which both extend the specification capabilities of Gradual C0 and increase the ease of encoding observer methods in Gradual C0.

Our key innovation is a type system that verifies each process directly against a global protocol specification, represented as a labelled transition system (LTS) in general, with global types as a special case. This approach uniquely avoids the need for intermediate local types and projection.\n  We demonstrate that our approach, while conceptually simpler, supports a benchmark of challenging protocols that were previously beyond the reach of compositional techniques in the MPST literature. We generalise our type system, showing that it can validate processes against any specification that constitutes a \"well-behaved\" LTS, supporting protocols not expressible with the standard global type syntax.

To avoid these challenges, researchers have developed techniques for internally deterministic parallel programming, in which the steps of a parallel computation proceed in a deterministic way. Internal determinism is useful because it lets a programmer reason about a program as if it executed in a sequential order. However, no verification framework exists to exploit this property and simplify formal reasoning about internally deterministic programs.\n  To capture the essence of why internally deterministic programs should be easier to reason about, this paper defines a property called schedule-independent safety. A program satisfies schedule-independent safety, if, to show that the program is safe across all orderings, it suffices to show that one terminating execution of the program is safe. We then present a separation logic called Musketeer for proving that a program satisfies schedule-independent safety. Once a parallel program has been shown to satisfy schedule-independent safety, we can verify it with a new logic called Angelic, which allows one to dynamically select and verify just one sequential ordering of the program.\n  Using Musketeer, we prove the soundness of MiniDet, an affine type system for enforcing internal determinism. MiniDet supports several core algorithmic primitives for internally deterministic programming that have been identified in the research literature, including a deterministic version of a concurrent hash set.

As demonstrated in the MaPLe compiler and run-time system, disentanglement can be exploited for fast automatic memory management, especially task-local garbage collection with no synchronization between parallel tasks. However, as a low-level property, disentanglement can be difficult to reason about for programmers. The only means of statically verifying disentanglement so far has been DisLog, an Iris-fueled variant of separation logic, mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant. DisLog is a fully-featured program logic, allowing for proof of functional correctness as well as verification of disentanglement. Yet its employment requires significant expertise and per-program proof effort.\n  This paper explores the route of automatic verification via a type system, ensuring that any well-typed program is disentangled and lifting the burden of carrying out manual proofs from the programmer. It contributes TypeDis, a type system inspired by region types, where each type is annotated with a timestamp, identifying the task that allocated it. TypeDis supports iso-recursive types as well as polymorphism over both types and timestamps.

In this paper, we identify two notions of locality unique to the quantum domain, and we construct a novel quantum separation logic, RapunSL, which is able to soundly reduce reasoning about superposition states to reasoning about pure states (basis-locality), and reasoning about mixed states arising from measurement to reasoning about pure states (outcome-locality).

Despite advancements in repository-level code translation, validating the translations remains challenging. This paper proposes TRAM, which combines context-aware type resolution with mock-based in-isolation validation to achieve high-quality translations between programming languages. Prior to translation, TRAM retrieves API documentation and contextual code information for each variable type in the source language. It then prompts a large language model (LLM) with retrieved contextual information to resolve type mappings across languages with precise semantic interpretations. Using the automatically constructed type mapping, TRAM employs a custom serialization/deserialization workflow that automatically constructs equivalent mock objects in the target language. This enables each method fragment to be validated in isolation, without the high cost of using agents for translation validation, or the heavy manual effort required by existing approaches that rely on language interoperability.

While some approaches exist for automating this task, most focus on the simple case of unitary circuits. At the same time, real quantum computing requires hybrid circuits equipped with measurement operators. Moreover, the few approaches targeting the hybrid case are limited to a restricted class of problems. We propose tackling the Quantum Hybrid Circuit Equivalence Checking problem through lifting unitary circuit verification using a transformation known as deferred measurement. We show that this approach alone significantly outperforms prior work, and that, with the addition of specific unitary-level techniques we call separation and projection, it can handle much larger classes of hybrid circuit equivalence problems. We have implemented and evaluated our method over standard circuit transformations such as teleportation, one-way measurement, or the IBM Qiskit compiler, demonstrating its promises. As a side finding, we have identified and reported several unexpected behaviours with the Qiskit compiler.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6d4b\u91cf\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u5408\u7535\u8def\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7535\u8def\u7b49\u4ef7\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u94fe\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7535\u8def\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u67e5\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u7b80\u5355\u5e7a\u6b63\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u8981\u5305\u542b\u6d4b\u91cf\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6df7\u5408\u7535\u8def\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c8\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u522b", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6d4b\u91cf\u53d8\u6362\u5c06\u5e7a\u6b63\u7535\u8def\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u6df7\u5408\u7535\u8def\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u6295\u5f71\u4e24\u79cd\u5e7a\u6b63\u7ea7\u6280\u672f\u6765\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7535\u8def\u7b49\u4ef7\u95ee\u9898", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u5927\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7535\u8def\u7b49\u4ef7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u7535\u8def\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u5982\u9690\u5f62\u4f20\u6001\u3001\u5355\u5411\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001IBM Qiskit\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86Qiskit\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u610f\u5916\u884c\u4e3a", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6d4b\u91cf\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7535\u8def\u7b49\u4ef7\u68c0\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u9645\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7535\u8def\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u95ee\u9898"}}

With the latter, the control flow is based on classical information, potentially resulting from a quantum measurement, and this paradigm is well-suited to mixed state quantum computation. Whereas with quantum control, we are primarily focused on pure quantum computation and there the \"control\" is based on superposition. The two paradigms have not mixed well traditionally and they are almost always treated separately. In this work, we show that the paradigms may be combined within the same system. The key ingredients for achieving this are: (1) syntactically: a modality for incorporating pure quantum types into a mixed state quantum type system; (2) operationally: an adaptation of the notion of \"quantum configuration\" from quantum lambda-calculi, where the quantum data is replaced with pure quantum primitives; (3) denotationally: suitable (sub)categories of Hilbert spaces, for pure computation and von Neumann algebras, for mixed state computation in the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u63a7\u5236\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u6cd5\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u91cf\u5b50\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u53e0\u52a0\u6001\uff09\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u63a7\u5236\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u88ab\u5206\u5f00\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6df7\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u6253\u7834\u8fd9\u79cd\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u4e24\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "1. \u8bed\u6cd5\u5c42\u9762\uff1a\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u7eaf\u91cf\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u7eb3\u5165\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b2. \u64cd\u4f5c\u5c42\u9762\uff1a\u6539\u7f16\u91cf\u5b50\u03bb\u6f14\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\"\u91cf\u5b50\u914d\u7f6e\"\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u539f\u8bed\u66ff\u6362\u91cf\u5b50\u6570\u636e\uff1b3. \u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b50\u8303\u7574\u5904\u7406\u7eaf\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u51af\u00b7\u8bfa\u4f9d\u66fc\u4ee3\u6570\u5b50\u8303\u7574\u5904\u7406\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08\u6d77\u68ee\u5821\u56fe\u666f\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u63a7\u5236\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u91cf\u5b50\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e24\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}
