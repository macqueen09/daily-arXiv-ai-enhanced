However, they are hard to program, leading developers to use vendor-provided kernel libraries that support tensor accelerators. As a result, the usage of tensor accelerators is limited to the provided interface, mainly designed for traditional ML and scientific computing workloads.\n  In this paper, we show that tensor accelerators can improve the performance of applications beyond simple variants of MatMul. For example, many image processing pipelines are linear transformations over matrices in disguise and can therefore utilize such specialized hardware. This is nonetheless hindered by the difficulties in programming tensor accelerators. We tackle this problem with compiler-based techniques. We use the Halide user-schedulable language and express operations as Halide algorithms succinctly. To this end, we implement a flexible tensor instruction selector based on equality saturation. The tensor instruction selector supports both CPU- and GPU-attached tensor accelerators and works with existing scheduling operations (e.g., producer-consumer fusion). Together, this enables developers to write diverse accelerator-leveraging applications in a few dozen lines.\n  Using our system, we demonstrate the potential of tensor accelerators beyond their traditional domains. We implement several image processing pipelines (e.g., filtering, resampling, and denoising) in our system and evaluate them against non-accelerator-leveraging baselines. We show that these pipelines can achieve significant speedups. For example, a downsampling routine is sped up by $6.1\\times$ by utilizing Tensor Cores on an Nvidia RTX 4070 GPU.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f20\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u4f20\u7edfML\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Halide\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u7b49\u5f0f\u9971\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u6307\u4ee4\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u5f20\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3CPU/GPU\u4e2d\u5360\u6bd4\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u7f16\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u4e8e\u5382\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684ML\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e93\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u6269\u5c55\u5f20\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u4efb\u52a1", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Halide\u53ef\u8c03\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b49\u5f0f\u9971\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u6307\u4ee4\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff0c\u652f\u6301CPU\u548cGPU\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u8c03\u5ea6\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u5982\u751f\u4ea7\u8005-\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u878d\u5408\uff09\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c", "result": "\u5728Nvidia RTX 4070 GPU\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u4f8b\u7a0b\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528Tensor Cores\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e866.1\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff08\u6ee4\u6ce2\u3001\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u53bb\u566a\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\u975e\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u57fa\u7ebf\u90fd\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f", "conclusion": "\u5f20\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edfML\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6280\u672f\u4f7f\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u80fd\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u4ee3\u7801\u7f16\u5199\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347"}}

Developers need detailed data on the energy consumption of their software to mitigate consumption issues. Previous approaches have a broader focus, such as on specific functions or programs, rather than source code statements. They primarily focus on estimating the CPU's energy consumption using point estimates, thereby disregarding other hardware effects and limiting their use for statistical reasoning and explainability. We developed a novel methodology to address the limitations of measuring only the CPU's consumption and using point estimates, focusing on predicting the energy usage of statically typed JVM-based programming languages, such as Java and Scala. We measure the energy consumption of Bytecode patterns, the translation from the programming language's source code statement to their Java Bytecode representation. With the energy measurements, we construct a statistical model using Bayesian statistics, which allows us to predict the energy consumption through statistical distributions and analyze individual factors. The model includes three factors we obtain statically from the code: data size, data type, operation, and one factor about the hardware platform the code executes on: device. To validate our methodology, we implemented it for Java and evaluated its energy predictions on unseen programs. We observe that all four factors are influential, notably that two devices of the same model may differ in energy consumption and that the operations and data types cause consumption differences. The experiments also show that the energy prediction of programs closely follows the program's real energy consumption, validating our approach. Our work presents a methodology for constructing an energy model that future work, such as verification tools, can use for their energy estimates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u5b57\u8282\u7801\u6a21\u5f0f\u80fd\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u7c7b\u578bJVM\u8bed\u8a00\uff08Java/Scala\uff09\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u6570\u636e\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u56db\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfCPU\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u80fd\u8017\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8CPU\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u786c\u4ef6\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570\u6216\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5c42\u9762\u800c\u975e\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u53e5\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b57\u8282\u7801\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u6267\u884c\u8bbe\u5907\u3002\u9488\u5bf9Java\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u56db\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\u90fd\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u540c\u578b\u53f7\u8bbe\u5907\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u5bfc\u81f4\u80fd\u8017\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\u5ea6\u543b\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u8017\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u7b49\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u80fd\u8017\u4f30\u8ba1\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8eCPU\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Lumos is an imperative probabilistic programming DSL over graphs, with constructs to generate independent and identically distributed prompts for LMS.

Lumos supports certifying LMS for arbitrary prompt distributions via integration with statistical certifiers. We provide hybrid (operational and denotational) semantics for Lumos, providing a rigorous way to interpret the specifications. Using only a small set of composable constructs, Lumos can encode existing LMS specifications, including complex relational and temporal specifications. It also facilitates specifying new properties - we present the first safety specifications for vision-language models (VLMs) in autonomous driving scenarios developed with Lumos. Using these, we show that the state-of-the-art VLM Qwen-VL exhibits critical safety failures, producing incorrect and unsafe responses with at least 90% probability in right-turn scenarios under rainy driving conditions, revealing substantial safety risks. Lumos's modular structure allows easy modification of the specifications, enabling LMS certification to stay abreast with the rapidly evolving threat landscape. We further demonstrate that specification programs written in Lumos enable finding specific failure cases exhibited by state-of-the-art LMS.

Move features a strong static type system and explicit resource semantics to enforce safety properties such as the prevention of data races, invalid asset transfers, and entry vulnerabilities. However, smart contracts written in Move may still contain certain vulnerabilities that are beyond the reach of its type system. It is thus essential to validate Move smart contracts. Unfortunately, due to its strong type system, existing smart contract fuzzers are ineffective in producing syntactically or semantically valid transactions to test Move smart contracts. This paper introduces the first fuzzing framework, Belobog, for Move smart contracts. Belobog is type-aware and ensures that all generated and mutated transactions are well-typed. More specifically, for a target Move smart contract, Belobog first constructs a type graph based on Move's type system, and then generates or mutates a transaction based on the graph trace derived from the type graph. In order to overcome the complex checks in Move smart contracts, we further design and implement a concolic executor in Belobog. We evaluated Belobog on 109 real-world Move smart contract projects. The experimental results show that Belobog is able to detect 100\\% critical and 79\\% major vulnerabilities manually audited by human experts. We further selected two recent notorious incidents in Move smart contracts, i.e., Cetus and Nemo.
