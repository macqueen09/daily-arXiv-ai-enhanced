The idea is that the creator of a contract on the blockchain equips code containing such constructs with a formal proof of its type safety, given in terms of the semantics of types. Then, a user of the contract only needs to check the validity of the provided `proof certificate' of type safety. This is a form of proof-carrying code, which naturally fits with the immutable nature of the blockchain environment.\n  As a concrete application of our approach, we focus on ensuring information flow control and non-interference for the language TINYSOL, a distilled version of the Solidity language, through security types. We provide the semantics of types in terms of a typed operational semantics of TINYSOL, and a way for expressing the proofs of safety as coinductively-defined typing interpretations and for representing them compactly via up-to techniques, similar to those used for bisimilarity. We also show how our machinery can be used to type the typical pointer-to-implementation pattern based on the fallback function. However, our main contribution is not the safety theorem per se (and so security properties different from non-interference can be considered as well), but rather the presentation of the theoretical developments necessary to make this approach work in a blockchain/smart-contract setting."}

When applied to the actor model, join patterns offer the novel capability of matching combinations of messages in the mailbox of an actor. Previous work by Philipp Haller et al. in the paper \"Fair Join Pattern Matching for Actors\" (ECOOP 2024) explored join patterns with conditional guards in an actor-based setting with a specification of fair and deterministic matching semantics. Nevertheless, the question of time efficiency in fair join pattern matching has remained underexplored. The stateful tree-based matching algorithm of Haller et al. performs worse than an implementation that adapts the Rete algorithm to the regular version of a join pattern matching benchmark, while outperforming on a variant with heavy conditional guards, which take longer to evaluate. Nevertheless, conforming Rete to the problem of join pattern matching requires heavy manual adaptation.\n  In this thesis, we enhance and optimize the stateful tree-based matching algorithm of Haller et al. to achieve up to tenfold performance improvements on certain benchmarks, approaching the performance of Rete on regular benchmarks while maintaining the advantages of versatility and performance with heavy guards. We also enhance the benchmark suite, adding new features and enhancing its extensibility and user-friendliness. We extend the join pattern implementation with a less ambiguous syntax as well as dynamic pattern switching. Finally, we present a new complex model use case for join patterns, showing their applicability in a microservice web architecture."}
