TL;DR: 提出一种新的函数式响应式编程语言，采用简化的模态类型系统，通过改变信号语义来增强表达能力，同时保证因果性、生产性和无空间泄漏等核心操作属性。

Motivation: 现有的函数式响应式编程（FRP）语言需要确保程序的因果性、生产性和无空间泄漏，虽然已有多种模态类型系统来强制这些操作属性，但这些系统通常限制较多，影响语言的表达能力。

Method: 设计新的FRP语言，采用简化的模态类型系统，将信号重新定义为可变引用，通过'later'类型模态严格控制可变性，允许更多程序通过类型检查，同时支持更高效的原位更新。

Result: 新语言在保持因果性、生产性和无空间泄漏保证的同时，比之前的模态FRP语言限制更少，表达能力更强，并且能够实现更高效的信号更新。

Conclusion: 通过改变信号语义和采用简化的模态类型系统，可以在不牺牲核心操作属性保证的前提下，创建更灵活、表达能力更强的FRP语言，同时保持函数式编程风格。

Abstract: Functional reactive programming (FRP) is a declarative programming paradigm for implementing reactive programs at a high level of abstraction. It applies functional programming principles to construct and manipulate time-varying values, also known as signals. However, for this programming paradigm to work in practice, an FRP language must ensure that programs are causal, productive, and free from space leaks. Over the past fifteen years, several modal type systems to enforce these operational properties have been developed.
  We present a new FRP language with a significantly simplified modal type system that imposes fewer restrictions than previous modal FRP languages while still guaranteeing the central operational properties of causality, productivity, and absence of space leaks. The key enabling idea is to alter the semantics of signals so that the type system can safely allow more programs to type-check, which also makes the language more expressive. With this new semantics, signals are modelled as mutable references whose mutability is tightly controlled by the 'later' type modality. This disciplined form of mutability also enables more efficient in-place updates of signals, all while preserving a functional programming style.
