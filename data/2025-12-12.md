  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归余代数虽能优雅建模递归算法，但证明余代数的递归性通常困难且特设，阻碍在证明助手中的形式化

Method: 引入良基函子概念，构建在良基关系索引的族范畴上，证明良基函子的每个余代数都是递归的

Result: 建立了递归性由类型保证的理论框架，统一了排名函数等传统技术，并通过快速排序、欧几里得算法、CYK解析等案例验证

Conclusion: 良基函子框架为递归算法提供了内在递归的建模方法，简化了形式化验证，已在Cubical Agda中成功实现

Abstract: Recursive coalgebras provide an elegant categorical tool for modelling recursive algorithms and analysing their termination and correctness. By considering coalgebras over categories of suitably indexed families, the correctness of the corresponding algorithms follows intrinsically just from the type of the computed maps. However, proving recursivity of the underlying coalgebras is non-trivial, and proofs are typically ad hoc. This layer of complexity impedes the formalization of coalgebraically defined recursive algorithms in proof assistants. We introduce a framework for constructing coalgebras which are intrinsically recursive in the sense that the type of the coalgebra guarantees recursivity from the outset. Our approach is based on the novel concept of a well-founded functor on a category of families indexed by a well-founded relation. We show as our main result that every coalgebra for a well-founded functor is recursive, and demonstrate that well-known techniques for proving recursivity and termination such as ranking functions are subsumed by this abstract setup. We present a number of case studies, including Quicksort, the Euclidian algorithm, and CYK parsing. Both the main theoretical result and selected case studies have been formalized in Cubical Agda.

### [2] [Towards Cumulative Abstract Semantics via Handlers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10861)
*Cade Lueker,Andrew Fox,Bor-Yuh Evan Chang*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于作用域的效应系统来模块化抽象解释框架，通过分离语法消除和领域语义引入处理程序，实现灵活的前向/后向、过近似/欠近似分析。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抽象解释框架缺乏真正的灵活性，难以支持不同的路径敏感性和流敏感性分析，且语法和语义通常紧密耦合，导致实现缺乏模块化。当前模块化设计方法（如单子变换器）虽然提供模块性但过于复杂。

Method: 提出累积抽象语义方法，利用作用域效应在解释器中积累语义片段。将效应分为两类：语法消除处理程序和领域语义引入处理程序，从而实现模块化设计。

Result: 展示了从单一解释器创建多个动态求值器和静态分析器的潜力，证明了效应作为设计工具能够构建干净、优雅且模块化的抽象解释框架。

Conclusion: 使用作用域效应是实现模块化抽象解释框架的有效方法，能够分离语法和语义关注点，提供灵活的分析能力，同时保持实现的简洁性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of modularizing control flow in a generic abstract interpretation framework. A generic abstract interpretation framework is not truly flexible if it does not allow interpreting with different path- and flow-sensitivities, by going forwards or backwards, and over- or under-approximately. Most interpreters inherently intertwine syntax and semantics, making the implementation antagonistic to modularity. Current approaches to modular designs require the use of complex data structures (e.g., monad transformers), providing modularity but often proving unwieldy (e.g., lifts). We observe that leveraging scoped effects within an interpreter facilitates the accumulation of semantic fragments against a fixed syntax. In this paper, we define cumulative abstract semantics, illustrating the potential for creating multiple dynamic evaluators and static analyses from one interpreter. This modularity is achieved by grouping effects into two categories: syntax elimination and domain-semantic introduction handlers. Our contribution shows the benefits of using effects as an instrument for designing a clean, elegant, and modular abstract interpretation framework.
