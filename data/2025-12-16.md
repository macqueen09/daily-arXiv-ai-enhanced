Motivation: 概率程序在机器学习和自主系统建模中有广泛应用，需要分析数值属性如概率和期望。后验分布是特别重要的定量属性，但精确计算（精确推理）具有挑战性。

Method: 使用加权自动机（有限自动机的泛化）来表示程序变量的分布（可能具有无限支持），将编程语言语义对应到自动机理论构造，如乘积、连接等操作。

Result: 提出了在受限的离散概率程序类中使用加权自动机进行精确推理的方法。

Conclusion: 加权自动机为概率程序的精确推理提供了有效的理论框架，能够处理可能具有无限支持的分布。

Abstract: Probabilistic programs encode stochastic models as ordinary-looking programs with primitives for sampling numbers from predefined distributions and conditioning. Their applications include, among many others, machine learning and modeling of autonomous systems. The analysis of probabilistic programs is often quantitative - it involves reasoning about numerical properties like probabilities and expectations. A particularly important quantitative property of probabilistic programs is their posterior distribution, i.e., the distribution over possible outputs for a given input (or prior) distribution. Computing the posterior distribution exactly is known as exact inference. We present our current research using weighted automata, a generalization of the well-known finite automata, for performing exact inference in a restricted class of discrete probabilistic programs. This is achieved by encoding distributions over program variables - possibly with infinite support - as certain weighted automata. The semantics of our programming language then corresponds to common automata-theoretic constructions, such as product, concatenation, and others.
