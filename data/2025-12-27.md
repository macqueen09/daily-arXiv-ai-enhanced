Motivation: 随着LLM在软件工程中的广泛应用，需要可靠评估LLM生成代码的正确性和安全性。现有手动构建的基准测试存在三个问题：(1) 容易污染训练数据，(2) 难以扩展到新任务，(3) 难以挑战更强大的LLM

Method: 提出AutoBaxBuilder框架，利用LLM的代码理解能力自动生成代码安全基准测试任务。采用细粒度合理性检查的鲁棒管道，构建功能测试和端到端安全探测漏洞

Result: 成功构建了AutoBaxBench基准测试集，与人类专家构建的任务进行比较验证了质量。每个新任务生成时间小于2小时，成本低于10美元。通过该基准评估了LLM在安全任务上的能力

Conclusion: AutoBaxBuilder能够有效解决手动基准测试的局限性，自动生成高质量的代码安全评估任务，为持续评估和改进LLM代码生成安全性提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: As LLMs see wide adoption in software engineering, the reliable assessment of the correctness and security of LLM-generated code is crucial. Notably, prior work has demonstrated that security is often overlooked, exposing that LLMs are prone to generating code with security vulnerabilities. These insights were enabled by specialized benchmarks, crafted through significant manual effort by security experts. However, relying on manually-crafted benchmarks is insufficient in the long term, because benchmarks (i) naturally end up contaminating training data, (ii) must extend to new tasks to provide a more complete picture, and (iii) must increase in difficulty to challenge more capable LLMs. In this work, we address these challenges and present AutoBaxBuilder, a framework that generates tasks and tests for code security benchmarking from scratch. We introduce a robust pipeline with fine-grained plausibility checks, leveraging the code understanding capabilities of LLMs to construct functionality tests and end-to-end security-probing exploits. To confirm the quality of the generated benchmark, we conduct both a qualitative analysis and perform quantitative experiments, comparing it against tasks constructed by human experts. We use AutoBaxBuilder to construct entirely new tasks and release them to the public as AutoBaxBench, together with a thorough evaluation of the security capabilities of LLMs on these tasks. We find that a new task can be generated in under 2 hours, costing less than USD 10.
