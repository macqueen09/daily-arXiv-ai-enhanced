For instance, agents may access sensitive data before authenticating users or process refunds to unauthorized payment methods, violations that require reasoning about sequences of action rather than an individual action. Existing guardrails rely on imprecise natural language instructions or post-hoc monitoring, and provide no formal guarantees that agents will satisfy temporal constraints. We present Agent-C, a novel framework that provides run-time guarantees ensuring LLM agents adhere to formal temporal safety properties. Agent-C introduces a domain-specific language for expressing temporal properties (e.g., authenticate before accessing data), translates specifications to first-order logic, and uses SMT solving to detect non-compliant agent actions during token generation. When the LLM attempts to generate a non-compliant tool call, Agent-C leverages constrained generation techniques to ensure that every action generated by the LLM complies with the specification, and to generate a compliant alternative to a non-compliant agent action. We evaluate Agent-C across two real-world applications: retail customer service and airline ticket reservation system, and multiple language models (open and closed-source). Our results demonstrate that Agent-C achieves perfect safety (100% conformance, 0% harm), while improving task utility compared to state-of-the-art guardrails and unrestricted agents. On SoTA closed-source models, Agent-C improves conformance (77.4% to 100% for Claude Sonnet 4.5 and 83.7% to 100% for GPT-5), while simultaneously increasing utility (71.8% to 75.2% and 66.1% to 70.6%, respectively), representing a new SoTA frontier for reliable agentic reasoning."}

We introduce a factor abstraction with five fundamental operations that serve as a universal interface for manipulating factors regardless of their underlying representation. This enables representation-agnostic probabilistic programming where users can freely mix different representations (e.g. discrete tables, Gaussians distributions, sample-based approaches) within a single unified framework, allowing practical inference in complex hybrid models that current toolkits cannot adequately express."}

Primary category cs.PL, secondary cs.DC", "summary": "The Virtual Garbage Collector (VGC) introduces a novel memory management framework designed to optimize performance across diverse systems, ranging from resource constrained embedded devices to high performance parallel architectures. Unlike conventional garbage collectors, VGC employs a dual layer architecture consisting of Active VGC and Passive VGC to enable efficient, low overhead memory management. Active VGC dynamically manages runtime objects using a concurrent mark and sweep strategy tailored for parallel workloads, reducing pause times by up to 30 percent compared to generational collectors in multithreaded benchmarks. Passive VGC operates at compile time and optimizes static object allocation through predictive memory mapping, minimizing fragmentation by aligning objects to cache boundaries. This separation of responsibilities ensures predictable memory access patterns, reduces total memory usage by up to 25 percent, and improves scalability for modern parallel applications. By integrating compile time and runtime optimizations, VGC provides a robust and adaptable solution for memory intensive systems across both low level and high level programming environments."}

This quantity informs two practical questions for enumeration-based model checking: how long a model checking run is likely to take, and what fraction of the search space has been covered so far. We first show the counting problem is #P-hard even for restricted programs and, unless $P=NP$, inapproximable within any subexponential factor, ruling out efficient exact or randomized approximation algorithms. We give a Monte Carlo approach to obtain a poly-time unbiased estimator: we convert a stateless optimal DPOR algorithm into an unbiased estimator by viewing its exploration as a bounded-depth, bounded-width tree whose leaves are the maximal Mazurkiewicz traces. A classical estimator by Knuth, when run on this tree, yields an unbiased estimate. To control the variance, we apply stochastic enumeration by maintaining a small population of partial paths per depth whose evolution is coupled. We have implemented our estimator in the JMC model checker and evaluated it on shared-memory benchmarks. With modest budgets, our estimator yields stable estimates, typically within a 20% band, within a few hundred trials, even when the state space has $10^5$--$10^6$ classes. We also show how the same machinery estimates model-checking cost by weighting all explored graphs, not only complete traces. Our algorithms provide the first provable poly-time unbiased estimators for counting traces, a problem of considerable importance when allocating model checking resources."}
