These methods are conceptually grounded in the abstract notion of a CuTe layout and a rich algebra of such layouts, including operations such as composition, logical product, and logical division. In this paper, we present a categorical framework for understanding this layout algebra by focusing on a naturally occurring class of tractable layouts. To this end, we define two categories Tuple and Nest whose morphisms give rise to layouts. We define a suite of operations on morphisms in these categories and prove their compatibility with the corresponding layout operations. Moreover, we give a complete characterization of the layouts which arise from our construction. Finally, we provide a Python implementation of our categorical constructions, along with tests that demonstrate alignment with CUTLASS behavior. This implementation can be found at our git repository https://github.com/ColfaxResearch/layout-categories."}
