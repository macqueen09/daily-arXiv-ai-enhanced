These methods are conceptually grounded in the abstract notion of a CuTe layout and a rich algebra of such layouts, including operations such as composition, logical product, and logical division. In this paper, we present a categorical framework for understanding this layout algebra by focusing on a naturally occurring class of tractable layouts. To this end, we define two categories Tuple and Nest whose morphisms give rise to layouts. We define a suite of operations on morphisms in these categories and prove their compatibility with the corresponding layout operations. Moreover, we give a complete characterization of the layouts which arise from our construction. Finally, we provide a Python implementation of our categorical constructions, along with tests that demonstrate alignment with CUTLASS behavior. This implementation can be found at our git repository https://github.com/ColfaxResearch/layout-categories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3aNVIDIA CUTLASS\u5e93\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u4ee3\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5e03\u5c40\u64cd\u4f5c\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u8303\u7574\u4e2d\u7684\u6001\u5c04\u8fd0\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86Python\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "CUTLASS\u5e93\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5f20\u91cf\u5e03\u5c40\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5e03\u5c40\u4ee3\u6570\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u8303\u7574Tuple\u548cNest\uff0c\u5176\u6001\u5c04\u4ea7\u751f\u5e03\u5c40\uff1b\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u6001\u5c04\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5e94\u5e03\u5c40\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff1b\u5b8c\u5168\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u6784\u9020\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5e03\u5c40\u4ee3\u6570\u4e0e\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86Python\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e0eCUTLASS\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u4e3aCUTLASS\u5e03\u5c40\u4ee3\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316GPU\u5f20\u91cf\u5e03\u5c40\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002"}}
