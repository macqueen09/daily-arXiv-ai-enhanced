As a target platform, our implementation uses Fluid, an open source programming language with a provenance-tracking runtime. Our agent-based tool supports a human author during the creation of transparent documents, identifying fragments of text which can be computed from data, such as numerical values selected from records or computed by aggregations like sum and mean, comparatives and superlatives like _better than_ and _largest_, trend-adjectives like _growing_, and similar quantitative or semi-quantitative phrases, and then attempts to synthesise a suitable Fluid query over the data which generates the target string. The resulting expression is inserted into the article's web page, turning the static text fragment into an interactable data-driven element able to reveal the data that underwrites the natural language claim. We evaluate our approach on a subset of SciGen, an open source dataset consisting of tables from scientific articles and their corresponding descriptions, which we extend with hand-generated counterfactual test cases to evaluate how well machine-generated expressions generalise. Our results show that gpt4o is often able to synthesise compound expressions extensionally compatible with our gold solutions."}

Today, securing these languages still demands substantial human effort to craft and enforce rules, imposing heavy burdens on typical administrators and creating critical production risks (e.g., misoperations that shut down servers).Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, vulnerability detection, and automated repair for languages like Python and JavaScript. However, their ability to assist with generating secure scripting-language code remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we present SecGenEval-PS, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on secure scripting generation, security analysis, and automated repair. Our results show that both proprietary and open-source models fall short in these areas. For instance, over 60% of PowerShell scripts produced by GPT-4o and o3-mini are insecure without structured guidance.To bridge this gap, we propose PSSec, a framework that combines data synthesis with fine-tuning to enhance model security capabilities. We develop a self-debugging agent that integrates static analyzers with the reasoning abilities of advanced LLMs to synthesize large-scale structured triplets of insecure scripts, violation analyses, and corresponding repairs. We then fine-tune lightweight LLMs (as small as 1.7B parameters) using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), enabling security-aware reasoning and the generation of secure PowerShell code.Across multiple LLM families, including GPT and Qwen, \\textit{PSSec}-trained models match or surpass general-purpose large models on PowerShell security tasks while reducing inference cost by more than an order of magnitude."}

The notion of FO-completeness is a theoretical guarantee that all theorems that are valid when recursive definitions are interpreted as fixpoint definitions (instead of least fixpoint) are guaranteed to be eventually proven by the system. The logics we develop are a frame logic ($\\textit{FL}$) and a separation logic ($\\textit{SL-FL}$) that has an alternate semantics inspired by frame logic. We show verification condition generation for FL that is amenable to FO-complete reasoning using quantifier instantiation and SMT solvers. We show $\\textit{SL-FL}$ can be translated to FL in order to obtain FO-complete reasoning. We implement tools that realize our technique and show the expressiveness of our logics and the efficacy of the verification technique on a suite of benchmarks that manipulate data structures."}
