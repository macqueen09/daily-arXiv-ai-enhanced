Sources: https://github.com/tweag/tbagrel-phd-manuscript/", "summary": "Destination-passing style programming introduces destinations, which represent the address of a write-once memory cell. These destinations can be passed as function parameters, allowing the caller to control memory management: the callee simply fills the cell instead of allocating space for a return value. While typically used in systems programming, destination passing also has applications in pure functional programming, where it enables programs that were previously unexpressible using usual immutable data structures.\n  In this thesis, we develop a core λ-calculus with destinations, {λ_d}. Our new calculus is more expressive than similar existing systems, with destination passing designed to be as flexible as possible. This is achieved through a modal type system combining linear types with a system of ages to manage scopes, in order to make destination-passing safe. Type safety of our core calculus was proved formally with the Coq proof assistant.\n  Then, we see how this core calculus can be adapted into an existing pure functional language, Haskell, whose type system is less powerful than our custom theoretical one. Retaining safety comes at the cost of removing some flexibility in the handling of destinations. We later refine the implementation to recover much of this flexibility, at the cost of increased user complexity.\n  The prototype implementation in Haskell shows encouraging results for adopting destination-passing style programming when traversing or mapping over large data structures such as lists or data trees."}

The goal of intermediate languages is to serve as a basis for compiler intermediate representations, allowing to represent expressive program transformations for optimisation and compilation, while preserving the properties that make programs compilable efficiently in the first place, such as the \"stackability\" of continuations. Intermediate logics are logics between intuitionistic and classical logic in terms of provability. Second-class continuations used in CPS-based intermediate languages correspond to a classical modal logic S4 with the added restriction that implications may only return modal types. This indeed corresponds to an intermediate logic, owing to the Gödel-McKinsey-Tarski theorem which states the intuitionistic nature of the modal fragment of S4. We introduce a three-kinded polarised sequent calculus for S4, together with an operational machine model that separates a heap from a stack. With this model we study a stackability property for the modal fragment of S4."}
