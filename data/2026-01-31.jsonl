It improves instruction-level parallelism by overlapping multiple iterations of a loop and executing them in parallel. Typically, it is implemented using heuristics. In this paper, we present an optimal software pipeliner based on a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) Solver. We show that our approach significantly outperforms heuristic algorithms and hand-optimization. Furthermore, we show how the solver can be used to give feedback to programmers and processor designers on why a software pipelined schedule of a certain initiation interval is not feasible."}

These human-designed rules often struggle to adapt to the complexity of modern software and hardware and lead to high maintenance burden. To address this challenge, we present Magellan, an agentic framework that evolves the compiler pass itself by synthesizing executable C++ decision logic. Magellan couples an LLM coding agent with evolutionary search and autotuning in a closed loop of generation, evaluation on user-provided macro-benchmarks, and refinement, producing compact heuristics that integrate directly into existing compilers. Across several production optimization tasks, Magellan discovers policies that match or surpass expert baselines. In LLVM function inlining, Magellan synthesizes new heuristics that outperform decades of manual engineering for both binary-size reduction and end-to-end performance. In register allocation, it learns a concise priority rule for live-range processing that matches intricate human-designed policies on a large-scale workload. We also report preliminary results on XLA problems, demonstrating portability beyond LLVM with reduced engineering effort."}
