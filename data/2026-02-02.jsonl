Giarrusso", "Gregory Malecha"], "title": "Recursive Mutexes in Separation Logic", "categories": ["cs.PL", "cs.LO"], "comment": null, "summary": "Mutexes (i.e., locks) are well understood in separation logic, and can be specified in terms of either protecting an invariant or atomically changing the state of the lock. In this abstract, we develop the same styles of specifications for \\emph{recursive} mutexes, a common variant of mutexes in object-oriented languages such as C++ and Java. A recursive mutex can be acquired any number of times by the same thread, and our specifications treat all acquires/releases uniformly, with clients only needing to determine whether they hold the mutex when accessing the lock invariant."}

SpecIBT is based on the novel observation that in the presence of CET-style protection, we can precisely detect BTB misspeculation for indirect calls and set the SLH misspeculation flag. We formalize SpecIBT as a transformation in Rocq and provide a machine-checked proof that it achieves relative security: any transformed program running with speculation leaks no more than what the source program leaks without speculation. This strong security guarantee applies to arbitrary programs, even those not following the cryptographic constant-time programming discipline."}
