Luke Ong"], "title": "Layered Modal ML: Syntax and Full Abstraction", "categories": ["cs.PL"], "comment": "22 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "MetaML-style metaprogramming languages allow programmers to construct, manipulate and run code. In the presence of higher-order references for code, ensuring type safety is challenging, as free variables can escape their binders. In this paper, we present Layered Modal ML (LMML), \\textit{the first metaprogramming language that supports storing and running open code under a strong type safety guarantee}. The type system utilises contextual modal types to track and reason about free variables in code explicitly.\n  A crucial concern in metaprogramming-based program optimisations is whether the optimised program preserves the meaning of the original program. Addressing this question requires a notion of program equivalence and techniques to reason about it. In this paper, we provide a semantic model that captures contextual equivalence for LMML, establishing \\textit{the first full abstraction result for an imperative MetaML-style language}. Our model is based on traces derived via operational game semantics, where the meaning of a program is modelled by its possible interactions with the environment. We also establish a novel closed instances of use theorem that accounts for both call-by-value and call-by-name closing substitutions."}

While language workbenches aim to enable modular development under the constraints of the language extension problem, one critical constraint -- separate compilation -- is often relaxed due to its complexity. However, this relaxation undermines artifact reusability and integration with common dependency systems. A key difficulty under separate compilation arises from managing attribute grammars, as extensions may introduce new attributes that invalidate previously generated abstract syntax tree structures. Existing approaches, such as the use of dynamic maps in the Neverlang workbench, favor flexibility at the cost of compile-time correctness, leading to potential runtime errors due to undefined attributes. This work addresses this issue by introducing nlgcheck, a theoretically sound static analysis tool based on data-flow analysis for the Neverlang language workbench. nlgcheck detects potential runtime errors -- such as undefined attribute accesses -- at compile time, preserving separate compilation while maintaining strong static correctness guarantees. Experimental evaluation using mutation testing on Neverlang-based projects demonstrates that nlgcheck effectively enhances robustness without sacrificing modularity or flexibility and with a level of performance that does not impede its adoption in daily development activities."}

PCSP serves as a generalization of the well-known Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). In the CSP framework, we define a set of variables, a set of constraints, and a finite domain $D$ that encompasses all possible values for each variable. The objective is to assign a value to each variable in such a way that all constraints are satisfied. In the graph variant of CSP, an underlying graph is considered and we have one variable corresponding to each vertex of the graph and one or several constraints corresponding to each edge. In PCSPs, we allow for certain constraints to be violated at a specified cost, aiming to find a solution that minimizes the total cost. Numerous classical compiler optimization tasks can be framed as PCSPs over control-flow graphs. Examples include Register Allocation, Lifetime-optimal Speculative Partial Redundancy Elimination (LOSPRE), and Optimal Placement of Bank Selection Instructions. On the other hand, it is well-known that control-flow graphs of structured programs are sparse and decomposable in a variety of ways. In this work, we rely on the Series-Parallel-Loop (SPL) decompositions as introduced by~\\cite{RegisterAllocation}. Our main contribution is a general algorithm for PCSPs over SPL graphs with a time complexity of \\(O(|G| \\cdot |D|^6)\\), where \\(|G|\\) represents the size of the control-flow graph. Note that for any fixed domain $D,$ this yields a linear-time solution. Our algorithm can be seen as a generalization and unification of previous SPL-based approaches for register allocation and LOSPRE. In addition, we provide experimental results over another classical PCSP task, i.e. Optimal Bank Selection, achieving runtimes four times better than the previous state of the art."}
