CSLib aims to be for computer science what Lean's Mathlib is for mathematics. Mathlib has been tremendously impactful: it is a key reason for Lean's popularity within the mathematics research community, and it has also played a critical role in the training of AI systems for mathematical reasoning. However, the base of computer science knowledge in Lean is currently quite limited. CSLib will vastly enhance this knowledge base and provide infrastructure for using this knowledge in real-world verification projects. By doing so, CSLib will (1) enable the broad use of Lean in computer science education and research, and (2) facilitate the manual and AI-aided engineering of large-scale formally verified systems."}
