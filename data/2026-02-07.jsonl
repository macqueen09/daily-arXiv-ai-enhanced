Formal verification can provide strong guarantees but requires precise specifications, which are difficult and costly to write manually. To address this challenge, we present Doc2Spec, a multi-agent framework that uses LLMs to automatically induce a specification grammar from natural-language rules and then generates formal specifications guided by the induced grammar. The grammar captures essential domain knowledge, constrains the specification space, and enforces consistent representations, thereby improving the reliability and quality of generated specifications. Evaluated on seven benchmarks across three programming languages, Doc2Spec outperforms a baseline without grammar induction and achieves competitive results against a technique with a manually crafted grammar, demonstrating the effectiveness of automated grammar induction for formalizing natural-language rules."}

Beyond providing asynchrony for algebraic effects, the resulting core calculus also naturally models examples such as pre-emptive multi-threading, (cancellable) remote function calls, multi-party applications, and even a parallel variant of runners of algebraic effects. In this paper, we study the normalisation properties of this calculus. We prove that if one removes general recursion from the original calculus, then the remaining calculus is strongly normalising, including both its sequential and parallel parts. However, this only guarantees termination for very simple asynchronous examples. To improve on this result, we also prove that the sequential fragment of the calculus remains strongly normalising when a controlled amount of interrupt-driven recursive behaviour is reintroduced. Our strong normalisation proofs are structured compositionally as a natural extension of Lindley and Stark's $\\top\\top$-lifting based approach for proving strong normalisation of effectful languages. All our results are also formalised in Agda."}

Our method is based on parameterized algebraic theories, which give a concrete syntax for strong monads on functor categories, and are a convenient framework for names and binding. Our programs are built from the key primitives `fork' and `wait'. `Fork' creates a child thread and passes its name (thread ID) to the parent thread. `Wait' allows us to wait for given child threads to finish. We provide a parameterized algebraic theory built from fork and wait, together with basic atomic actions and laws such as associativity of `fork'. Our equational axiomatization is complete in two senses. First, for closed expressions, it completely captures equality of labelled posets (pomsets), an established model of concurrency: model complete. Second, any two open expressions are provably equal if they are equal under all closing substitutions: syntactically complete. The benefit of algebraic effects is that the semantic analysis can focus on the algebraic operations of fork and wait. We then extend the analysis to a simple concurrent programming language by giving operational and denotational semantics. The denotational semantics is built using the methods of parameterized algebraic theories and we show that it is sound, adequate, and fully abstract at first order for labelled-poset observations."}
