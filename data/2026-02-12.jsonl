Implementability asks whether a given global protocol admits a distributed implementation. We present the first comprehensive investigation of global protocol implementability modulo network architectures. We propose a set of network-parametric Coherence Conditions, and exhibit sufficient assumptions under which it precisely characterizes implementability. We further reduce these assumptions to a minimal set of operational axioms describing insert and remove behavior of individual message buffers. Our reduction immediately establishes that five commonly studied asynchronous network architectures, namely peer-to-peer FIFO, mailbox, senderbox, monobox and bag, are instances of our network-parametric result. We use our characterization to derive optimal complexity results for implementability modulo networks, relationships between classes of implementable global protocols, and symbolic algorithms for deciding implementability modulo networks. We implement the latter in the first network-parametric tool Sprout(A), and show that it achieves network generality without sacrificing performance and modularity."}

We introduce MerLin, an open source framework designed as a discovery engine for photonic and hybrid quantum machine learning. MerLin integrates optimized strong simulation of linear optical circuits into standard PyTorch and scikit learn workflows, enabling end to end differentiable training of quantum layers. MerLin is designed around systematic benchmarking and reproducibility. As an initial contribution, we reproduce eighteen state of the art photonic and hybrid QML works spanning kernel methods, reservoir computing, convolutional and recurrent architectures, generative models, and modern training paradigms. These reproductions are released as reusable, modular experiments that can be directly extended and adapted, establishing a shared experimental baseline consistent with empirical benchmarking methodologies widely adopted in modern artificial intelligence. By embedding photonic quantum models within established machine learning ecosystems, MerLin allows practitioners to leverage existing tooling for ablation studies, cross modality comparisons, and hybrid classical quantum workflows. The framework already implements hardware aware features, allowing tests on available quantum hardware while enabling exploration beyond its current capabilities, positioning MerLin as a future proof co design tool linking algorithms, benchmarks, and hardware."}
