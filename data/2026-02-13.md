Motivation: 研究GPT-5在低资源或不常用编程语言（如Idris）中的能力，探索如何通过反馈驱动的提示来提升其在陌生语言环境下的表现

Method: 使用Exercism平台的Idris练习，评估多种精炼策略：基于平台反馈的迭代提示、添加文档和错误分类指南、使用本地编译错误和失败测试用例的迭代提示

Result: 零样本提示仅解决22/56个问题；使用本地编译错误的迭代提示效果最好，将性能提升到54/56个问题；Python和Erlang的基线性能分别为45/50和35/47

Conclusion: 虽然大语言模型在低资源环境中可能表现不佳，但结构化的编译器级别反馈对于释放其能力至关重要

Abstract: GPT-5, a state of the art large language model from OpenAI, demonstrates strong performance in widely used programming languages such as Python, C++, and Java; however, its ability to operate in low resource or less commonly used languages remains underexplored. This work investigates whether GPT-5 can effectively acquire proficiency in an unfamiliar functional programming language, Idris, through iterative, feedback driven prompting. We first establish a baseline showing that with zero shot prompting the model solves only 22 out of 56 Idris exercises using the platform Exercism, substantially underperforming relative to higher resource languages (45 out of 50 in Python and 35 out of 47 in Erlang). We then evaluate several refinement strategies, including iterative prompting based on platform feedback, augmenting prompts with documentation and error classification guides, and iterative prompting using local compilation errors and failed test cases. Among these approaches, incorporating local compilation errors yields the most substantial improvements. Using this structured, error guided refinement loop, GPT-5 performance increased to an impressive 54 solved problems out of 56. These results suggest that while large language models may initially struggle in low resource settings, structured compiler level feedback can play a critical role in unlocking their capabilities.
