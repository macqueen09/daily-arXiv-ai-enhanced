Motivation: 数据科学家处理机器学习预测（如视频中的物体检测和轨迹）时，由于真实世界数据的模糊性，编写查询程序具有挑战性，特别是需要手动调整实值参数

Method: 提出Quivr框架，通过给定示例合成轨迹查询；引入参数空间剪枝技术和定量语义来提高合成效率

Result: 在17个任务基准测试中，Quivr能够为每个任务合成准确的查询，且优化技术显著减少了合成时间

Conclusion: Quivr框架有效解决了轨迹查询中参数调整的挑战，通过自动合成和优化技术提高了开发效率

Abstract: Data scientists often need to write programs to process predictions of machine learning models, such as object detections and trajectories in video data. However, writing such queries can be challenging due to the fuzzy nature of real-world data; in particular, they often include real-valued parameters that must be tuned by hand. We propose a novel framework called Quivr that synthesizes trajectory queries matching a given set of examples. To efficiently synthesize parameters, we introduce a novel technique for pruning the parameter space and a novel quantitative semantics that makes this more efficient. We evaluate Quivr on a benchmark of 17 tasks, including several from prior work, and show both that it can synthesize accurate queries for each task and that our optimizations substantially reduce synthesis time.
