However, writing such queries can be challenging due to the fuzzy nature of real-world data; in particular, they often include real-valued parameters that must be tuned by hand. We propose a novel framework called Quivr that synthesizes trajectory queries matching a given set of examples. To efficiently synthesize parameters, we introduce a novel technique for pruning the parameter space and a novel quantitative semantics that makes this more efficient. We evaluate Quivr on a benchmark of 17 tasks, including several from prior work, and show both that it can synthesize accurate queries for each task and that our optimizations substantially reduce synthesis time.", "AI": {"tldr": "Quivr\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u793a\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u7cca\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u7f16\u5199\u67e5\u8be2\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u5b9e\u503c\u53c2\u6570", "method": "\u63d0\u51faQuivr\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed9\u5b9a\u793a\u4f8b\u5408\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bed\u4e49\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5408\u6210\u6548\u7387", "result": "\u572817\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cQuivr\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5408\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u65f6\u95f4", "conclusion": "Quivr\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u6548\u7387"}}
