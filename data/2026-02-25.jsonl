This paper reports a benchmark methodology and corresponding results for three compiler-controlled mechanisms in an MLIR-based compilation pipeline: vectorization (Vec), multi-threading (MT) across hardware contexts, and double buffering (DB) using ping--pong scratchpad buffers to overlap DMA transfers with compute. Using Triton/Inductor-generated kernels, we present an ablation ladder that separates the contribution of Vec, MT, and DB, and we quantify how MT speedup scales with problem size using GELU as a representative activation kernel. The results show that vectorization provides the primary gain for bandwidth-sensitive kernels, MT delivers substantial improvements once scheduling overhead is amortized, and DB provides additional benefit when transfers and compute can be overlapped (i.e., outside the extremes of purely memory-bound or purely compute-bound behavior)."}

While domain-specific techniques achieve impressive speedups, e.g., in the context of database queries, they are difficult to generalize. Meanwhile, general approaches offer little support for incrementalizing domain-specific operations. In this work, we present DeCo, a novel core calculus for incremental functional programming with support for a wide range of user-defined data types. Despite its generic nature, our approach statically incrementalizes domain-specific operations on user-defined data types. It is, hence, more fine-grained than other generic techniques which resort to treating domain-specific operations as black boxes. We mechanized our work in Lean and proved it sound, meaning incrementalized execution computes the same result as full reevaluation. We also provide an executable implementation with case studies featuring examples from linear algebra, relational algebra, dictionaries, trees, and conflict-free replicated data types, plus a brief performance evaluation on linear and relational algebra and on trees."}

To this end, this paper outlines the creation of an Agentic Infused Software Ecosystem (AISE), that rests on three pillars. The first, of course, is the AI agents themselves, which in the past 5 years have moved from simple code completion and toward sophisticated independent development tasks, a trend which will only continue. The second pillar is the programming language and APIs (or tools) that these agents use to accomplish tasks, and increasingly, serve as the communication substrate that humans and AI agents interact and collaborate through. The final pillar is the runtime environment and ecosystem that agents operate within, and which provide the capabilities that programmatic agents use to interface with (and effect actions in) the external world. To realize the vision of AISE, all three pillars must be advanced in a holistic manner, and critically, in a manner that is synergistic for AI agents as they exist today, those that will exist in the future, and for the human developers that work alongside them."}
